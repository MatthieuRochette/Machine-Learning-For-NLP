books||4.0||This audio-book was fantastic. It took off like a horse out of the starting gate at the Kentucky Derby and never let up.Vincente Callabrese is a part time enforcer/collector for the mob and part time movie producer student. When Vincente is asked to produce one of his classmates screen plays this is a start of a new career for Vincente.First a name change, from Vincente Callabrese to Michael Vincent. Then it's off to Hollywood where he rapidly becomes one of the hottest producers in the movie business.Unfortunately, Michael has a hard time shaking his past. When he tries to buy the movie rights to a novel and is refused, he asks his old friend Tommy Povenzano for help. Tommy assures Michael the he will help. This is the start of all of Michael's problems.In typical Woods fashion this novel is a mover. Though this novel isn't full of excitement, it will keep you on the edge of your seat wanting to see what happens next. It doesn't take long between incidents.The bottom line here is that this is a book not to be missed.Choke Dead In the WaterOrchid BeachThese are all other options by Mr. Stuart and I would recommend any of them.Though this book has not won any awards Mr. Woods won the Edgar Alan Poe award in 1982 and was nominated again in 1992. Once you have read or listened to this book you will understand why.
books||4.0||Jesse Stone is sort of Spenser's alter ego. He's younger, and Spenser's never had a drinking problem, but other than that, they're pretty much the same character, except Stone's about thirty years younger. Robert B. Parker has been writing detective novels for a very long time now: this is the fourth Stone novel, there are 31 Spenser novels, three featuring his third character, Sunny Randall, and nine books that aren't part of a series, some of them non-fiction. That's 47 books, for those who aren't keeping up with the math. Obviously, by now Parker knows what he's doing. He seems able to write one of these every six months or so: he alternates between Randall, Spenser, and Stone with ease, and just floats along.In this outing, Stone's faced with a real problem. Paradise (the town he's Chief of Police in) has been hit by a rash of killings, and it's soon apparent that they're the work of a serial killer, or killers. Stone has no way of tracking the killer at first, and the killers seem able to strike with impunity and kill whoever they wish.Meanwhile, there's also a scared girl at the local high school, the victim of a gang rape and some threats afterwards. Stone has to resolve things, and control the situation so that the girl doesn't get hurt.And of course there's his personal life, which has been a problem for him since the series started with Night Passage. His ex-wife is a manipulative sociopath, interested in only herself and how she can control him, near as I can tell. In this installment, she attempts to manipulate him more than she should, and things take some interesting turns.I enjoyed this book a great deal, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for some light reading
books||2.0||I'm thankful that I was able to get this book at the library and didn't spend $15.00 buying it.  I own The Blue Day Book by the same author and I think it's fantastic and it cheers me up right away.  He should have stopped with that book. It claims to be a witty, thought-provoking book that makes an ideal gift for anyone who's seeking their true purpose and wants to laugh along the way.  The only thing this book has going for it is the amazing animal pictures.  It did have one thought that I really liked:  "Some people say that life is all about acquiring knowledge.  If that's true, then why do smart people dress so badly?"
books||2.0||This book tries to convince non-Christian skeptics but seems to spend too much time justifying orthodox perceptions and concepts of prayer and liturgy, without addressing fundamental objections
books||1.0||I was disappointed with this purchase. If you read the book jacket, you have gotten about all of the information out of it that's coming.
books||2.0||The book claims to help you:1. Say goodbye to aching joints, sagging skin and fatigue2. Improve the quality and function of the genetic material in your cells3. Ramp up your body's self-repair functions4. Increase your stamina, endurance and sex drive5. Dramatically improve your resistance to disease, including cancers6. Have more youthful, radiant skinYou don't need to be a cynic to be able to tell that the claims are all inflated. Sure, you'll see some improvement if you have been leading a very unhealthy lifestyle, but for those of us who are already exercising regularly and eating a relatively healthy diet, some of the tips on progressing further to "genetic repair" will sound a bit too good to be true.In fact, most of the advice and recommendations given in the book are not very different from that found in many other books on nutrition and supplement. The authors just gave all the info a "DNA twist". I stopped reading the book a few chapters from the end when it begins to talk about hormonal supplementation and some glowing testimonial on the author's services. All "natural"? No side effects? How long have the subjects been followed up and how long have physicians really practised hormonal therapy on otherwise healthy individuals? The results may be real, but how safe is it for the rest of subject's life?Sounds like another one of those practice-promoting books in this genre. Disappointing
books||1.0||As a professional, certified chef and baker, I am also an avid baking and cookbook collector. After seeing that this book won and the James Beard and the 'IACP Cookbook of the Year' awards -both prominently displayed on the cover of this book- and after reading the 'too good to be true'-reviews on Amazon -some reviewers sound so exalted and in trance as if Peter Reinhart is the Jesus Christ of Bread- I finally decided to buy this expensive book. What a dissappointment! For all those blindly following Reinhart as he were the Saviour of True Bread, wake up! Reinhart's book is simply flawed. Compared to other bread books, it's even a quite average book. But one that is luxuriously packaged. A lot of hot colorful expensive air. And it's expensive not because of the info and exlusive bread knowledge in it, but because of the super luxuriously editing. This is a book for book enthousiasts, not for bakers, professional or home. I see baking and cookbooks mainly as working tools, as information and inspiration. Not as eye candy. If you want nice pictures, buy an art book. A book on baking bread with these awards behind it, should give you tons of new info about ingredients and techniques, original insights, an appetite for baking, factual info, the newest and tested developments in technique... What you get here is a fluffed up egotrip. 47 formulas and ample bread info packaged into a shining 30-40$ publishing hype.Don't get me wrong: this is a beautiful, expensive book. But one you don't use in the kitchen, and certainly don't smudge with butter but put on the coffee table in the living room to impress guests and have polite conversations about. But as a source of new information or enlightening up to date bread knowledge, giving pointers about using new bread ingredients combined with old proven bread baking techniques, as a working tool sweating near the hot oven at home or at a bakery, compared to other bread books, this book fails miserably info-wise. But it has a snappy lay out. Jeff Hamelmans 'Bread, a Book of Techniques' and Rose Beranbaums 'Bread Bible' give the readers much more practical info and insight into bread baking. They talk more about the subject 'bread'. And not about themselves like Peter Reinhart clearly relishes. Mr Reinhart clearly sees himself as so important and interesting a person that we read in this book about his wife and their sightseeing in Paris. How about the bread info, the kneading, rising, baking, ingredient- and techniques info? I honestly prefer industrious bakers who pass on their baking knowledge clearly without having to read at which hotel room they stayedin. Bakers with such big ego's that think that readers of a Bread Baking book are more interested in the shopping experiences of the wife during 'a learning trip' to professional bakers on which she accompanied him, than in another bread formula's, should work in shobizz, not in a bakery or a culinary school. Big ego's with more talk than substance galore in the food industry. Reinart is, judging by this book, sadly also one of them. I don't see in a 1000 years Rose Beranbaum in one of her books rambling on about her husbands prefered color of ties or Jeff Hamelman writing in a bread book about the time he spent with his wife in Paris. Mr.Reinhart: your readers forked out 30-40$ for bread info, not your personal travel experiences. As you as a teachers no doubts sometimes say to a pupil: Stay with the subject! And the subject of this book, for which I paid is 'Bread and Baking. If we want to know about your personal life, we'll read an interview in People, if they find you interesting enough.Peter Reinharts 'The Bread Baker's Apprentice' as a 'Bread Book' is simply a marketing creation. Smartly edited, but way too short on substance. There is not much new information on bread. Worse: there is not much info at all! In total for 30-40 $, you get exactly 47 formulas on 307 pages of which 2 color photo pages are simply ads for other books by Ten Speed Press, the editor or this book. Compared to Beranbaums 640 pages, Hamelmans 400 plus pages, that is a big difference for a big price. With Reinharts book, you get a lot of shining white surface that in other Bread books is filled with bread info. As a buyer of this book, you also pay for full page black-and-white and color pictures that are pure filler. See p. 3, 6, 26... And why is the beautiful model Fumie on the cover of a bread book and not mr. Reinhart himself or even ... bread alone? With Reinharts next book they will no doubt put Kate Moss in an apron and a bakers vest. Package the air attractive enough and the readers will swallow it and fork out the 30-40$. Never mind the content. Let's talk a bit about the formula's. That should be an important part of a baking book, right? And they should be original and fine tuned, right? Sadly to say: nothing new or original here. Some aren't even fine tuned. And baking is all about fine tuning. Worse, almost all the formula's can be found in other bread books. And, most insulting for a buyer of this book, a lot of the mere 47 formulas (Reinhart uses this expensive word because 'recipe' propably doesn't fit into the marketing of this baking book) in this book are rehashed or directly derived from Reinharts former book 'Crust and Crumb'. Clever marketing and ba-da-bing! By the way, 'Crust and Crumb' has been reedited in 2006. At a fair price, I admit. So if you want your dose of Reinhart at a right price without the pomp, scï¿½nes of a marriage, without Peter Reinharts comment on the Eiffel tower so to speak... buy 'Crust and Crumb' and leave this luxuriously edited egotrip on the shelves. But before I buy I would also first flip through Beranbaums and Hamelmans bread books in the bookshop or in the Amazon shop. As for this book, you should ask yourself: 'Do I want a serious bread book or a nice coffeetable book?'. Taking in consideration all the egostroking in this book and in reviews, as a baking book for the world market, this book is almost worthless. The universal accepted working standard in worldwide baking is metric weight. Like it or not, but that's a fact. You weigh your ingredients carefully by grams, kilo's etc. Reinhart visited French top bakers Poilane and Gosselin, clearly admires them and aspires to reach their level of baking. I don't think that Poilane measures in cups and ounces! But even then, let Reinhart measure in cups for the home market. But then have the decency to add the metric equivalent in the formula's itself for the rest of the world. This guy goes on and on about his wish to bake authentic European inspired bread like ciabatta, fougasse... About a Worldwide Bread Revolution! And then he refuses to use the most important tool to make these breads: the same language, the metric weight system. Rose Beranbaum places the metric equivalent next to the cups/ounces. It's a simple as that. Bread is a world food, so use the world standard for baking. If not, market your book mainly to the USA market and be honest and upfront about that. And don't give us that inflated hot air babble about a Worldwide Bread Revolution without using the worldwide accepted working standard, the metric wieght system! This big flaw makes the book almost useless for bakers outside the USA. The Worldwide Bread Revolution won't be for tommorrow if we have to use this book worldwide!Next point: Reinhart advocates instant yeast over fresh pressed yeast. Every baker worth his salt (or yeast) will tell you that fresh yeast gives a far better taste, volume and texture. Yeast is a living organism. As 'instant yeast' it has been dried and put on the shelves for God knows how long. It's like you force a just woken up coma-patient, that has been dormant for months, years... to run a marathon. Fresh, pressed yeast is still alive and its taste and texture are a world of difference compared to 'instant' (aka dried) yeast. Try the difference between fresh yeast and instant yeast for taste and texture and fully developed rising at home, and judge for yourself. To place fresh yeast on the same level as instant yeast is preposterous for someone like Reinhart who spends days on his pre ferments! For scientific back up, you can always read the recently translated book of world renowed food scientist Herve This 'Molecular Gastronomy, Exploring the Science of Flavor' (Columbia University Press 2006).And it gets worse. Reinhart frequently uses shortening instead of butter or olive oil in his breads. If Poilane hears this, he'll drop dead! Every baker knows that even a small amount of butter gives a much better taste and texture than shortening. Shortening produces a rancid/metallic taste and a slimy, unpleasant mouthfeel. Not to talk about health. Most shortening is choc full of trans fats which are much more unhealty than butter fat. Read Harvard's nutrition professor Walter Willets book: 'Eat, Drink and be Healthy' (Free Press 2001). New York has already picked this info up. Professional food writer and teacher Reinhart hasn't or doesn't care. For instance, Reinhart proudly declares -not as a joke- that in Italian bread you can use shortening instead of olive oil. In Italian Bread! Come on, let's be serious. And this guy teaches at the Culinary Institute of America! It's like he is advocating spam to put on the BBQ instead of beef! If that is the standard of baking that Reinhart uses, he'll have to wait a long time to reach the standards of a Poilane. Then there is Reinharts Hygiï¿½ne Problem. There is an international standard for basic hygiene in food called the Hazzard Analysis of Critical Control Points (HACCP). Reinhart as a professional tutor and teacher must no doubt know the HACCP by heart. The first thing in hygiene that an apprentice baker learns, is that before even touching ingredients, he must remove all the rings on his fingers. Because the place underneath a wedding band for instance, is the place where the filth gathers and bacteria feast. And kneading dough with all that filth underneath a wedding band that you keep on, is not only very dangerous for the health of customers, it is simply not done for a baker. I like my bread without filth baked in, thank you very much! In the school where I earned my diplome in baking, if a student had a ring on during practical class, he had to leave the class immediately and he lost important points for his exam. Yet we see professional teacher and Bread Book Author Reinhart kneading dough WITH HIS WEDDING BAND ON! See p. 36-37, 82-83, 255, 245... Unforgivable in a 'professional' baking book. And all the more in an expensive book that won the James Beard and IACP awards! Has anyone of the juries of the James Beard Foundation and the IACP, any basic knowledge of food hygiene? Has nobody seen this cardinal sin against food hygiï¿½ne in a so called 'professional Bread Book'? One other thing, for a bread book that pretends to be world class, there is no word about gluten-free bread. Not one formula. And this while more and more people are allergic to gluten (protein in wheat flour).To end on a positive note, one thing I found acceptable in this expensive coffee table book, was his 55 pages with the 12 stages of bread. But, fellow reviewers, you can find all this info and more, and explained more clearly, more detailed and to the point, in Hamelmans 'Bread' and Beranbaums 'Bread Bible'. And it doesn't take 55 pages of expensive high quality shining white paper. Peter, take out all the white empty space, learn to write more clearly and to the point, and you can say the same thing in 20 pages. Which leaves you 35 pages for more formula's for example. But if you haven't any formula's left or are preparing a new book, then, yes, by all means stretch the 12 stages of bread to 55 scarcely printed pages instead of 20. Why make it simple if you can make it seem difficult, impress your not so knowledgable readers and in doing so stroking your own ego?So despite all the hoopla, hyped reviews, near hysterical praise and important awards, this is simply a too expensive, show off-book. It's like the tale of 'the King with no Clothes on'. Somebody has to yell: 'Hey, wait a minute!'If you want good books on bread baking: buy one by Jeff Hamelman, Rose Beranbaum and Bernard Clayton. You don't get a model on the cover, but the content is all the better. And in a bread book, isn't content more important than packaging
books||1.0||If you are a Christian, this book isn't for you. It is full of blashphemy, concluding that we must "... forgive God" and that we must love God "... even if He isnt perfect". Kusher even has the will to say that "...God would not be God..." without our love for Him. At one point he reduces God to an aminal saying that in the garden of Eden, when God said "...let US make man in OUR image" he was speking to animals and creation. Kusher explains that God created the world, and in the next paragraph that we came by evolution.  Since when was God in need of forgiveness? Isnt it that "... God so loved the world" and it wasnt us that loved God? I have no words in describing this book. It is full of error, because it does not base it self on the Gospel of Jesus Christ. All this book does is frees you from the thought that you are a sinner, and that it isnt your fault, and that actully you are a good person. Why do bad things happen to good people? Wrong question. There are no good people in the world in the first place. " for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God..." The world is in sin. The world DOES NOT HAVE GOOD PEOPLE!! Only by the grace of God, through faith in Jesus Christ you are made righteous. I beg you in the name of Jesus Christ to stay away from this book. It hasnt helped 4 million people, but it lied to them. Kusher, please turn from your ways and come to Jesus, then will you understand the life question "WHY"
books||1.0||Of all the textbooks I've had, from elementary school through graduate school, this is easily the worst one I've ever had, for any course. First of all, the authors so redundantly use the word "whilst" and the phrase "rules of the game" that it really gets on your nerves. My classmates all agree with me on this point. Second, speaking of getting on your nerves, half of what these authors say is, "...as we talked about in the previous chapter" or "as we'll talk about in the next chapter". There is so much redundant language in this book that it really could be condensed to about 25% of its size, and hell, it probably could simply be a chapter in the text for some other course. Third, the authors should win a Pulitzer prize for flowery language. They seem more interested in impressing me than educating me. Their sentences are far too long. They don't know the meaning of clear and concise, and I think they should all go back to English Composition 101. They'd be great politicians, because never have I heard anyone say so much and yet say so little....over and over and over again. The book is a like an inflated academic paper...and it's BORING. If ever a topic begged for a case-study approach, it's this one, and this book is not the answer. Save your money, and beg your instructor not to use this text. 
books||5.0||This entry in the Fang Mulheisen series came as a surprise. It was closer to something by Elmore Leonard or even Carl Hiaassen. Great, engaging  characters, funny dialogue and an excellent plot
books||5.0||The quirky illustrations done by the masterful Dave McKean at once contribute to the book's charm, but also lend to its dread. However, this is not a book for especially wee ones or children prone to nightmares. Some people may not appreciate Dave McKean's artwork as much as they should, because it is so different, at least to those not familiar with the Sandman graphic novel series written by Neil Gaiman in which Dave McKean did the cover art for all the books. At first glance the layout might seem confusing, even distracting, yet it somehow works here. Neil Gaiman has crafted an eerie tale that befits his style of writing. He introduces us to a charming young girl named Lucy, who suspects something is not right with her home. And though her pig-puppet seems to share her concern and understands her fear, the rest of her family do not...until it's too late. The action waxes and wanes until all seems resolved in the end, though perhaps it is not. You be the judge. This is a worthy book to read to third-graders and above, though some younger children may be able to stomach the tale without any concern. Neil Gaiman deserves praise for bringing his brand of storytelling to a younger audience, one so unfamiliar with his other work. I highly recommend this book
books||5.0||I read this book a couple of years ago, and I have just recently started to read it again. As much as I liked Lonsome Dove and Larry McMurtry's ability to wrenches your heart by eliminating characters you fall for; Greg  Matthews stings your senses with the characters he develops
books||2.0||While I found the writing style good and the information interesting, the actual diet was unrealistic, too restrictive and lacking fun basics that make other diets tolerable. I found myself longing for spices (how bad could pepper really be?) and questioning the validity of their restriction. I couldn't stand the ground-up flax seeds in my cranberry cocktail - the texture reminded me of trying to drink mud with little bugs in it (or what I imagine that to be).I'm not writing this to disparage anyone from trying the diet - if you can handle the restrictions and you have the self-control required, you might find this diet doable and rewarding. I tried the Fat Flush with a group from work - inspired by one woman who is able to do the flush again and again every year (she always gains the weight back). The rest of us, while successful for varying degrees of short periods, found the diet unrealistic for any long-term results - all of us gained the weight back and spurred by instant weight loss, some even picked up worse habits than they began with.The funny thing is I found much of the health information useful or interesting, but I got rid of the book b/c sitting on my shelf it reminded  me of unrealistic goals and failure - not what I want out of a get-healthy  plan. I'm writing this review so that others don't get sucked in by all of the positive reviews hoping for lasting results - 3 of us didn't have any
books||1.0||This "novel" would be better suited for the stage.  It reads like a play, often.It's not realistic as the author goes overboard in depicting "high drama" within a family.  They suffer a tragedy that would certainly affect a family but to the extent the author has them changing is not realistic at all.There are far too many scenes of shouting, histrionics.  The father goes from being Ward Cleaver to a verbally abusive monster.  If I had to see the mother one more time with her calling "Robin!" I was going to scream.The author needs to understand that high drama and a climax will be inferred by the reader after seeing the conflict.  This author forces the climax onto us in every scene.  He's desperate for this end result of angst, high drama and shock.It's overkill.  I don't believe that a 14 year old would become this promiscuous.  Sure it happens but this was the Leave it to Beaver family at first.  It just doesn't make sense that because of ONE incident, all members of the family devolve into sordid disasters.In short, the author needs to be focused more on telling a story, allowing the reader to infer.  Instead, he thrusts high drama and climax onto us at every turn.  It's ironic, actually, as he's trying to make us feel drama but he did it so much that I just felt tedium.Very, very contrived and forced novel.  Not believable.  I do not recommend
books||5.0||This is probably the single best work I've ever seen on the "science" of packing. Joe Back lived and worked in N.W. Wyoming, and was a legend in the area. His humorous annecdotes, and extremely accurate hand drawn diagrams, combined with his obvious knowledge of the subject, make this a "must have" for anyone seriously interested in learning how to pack horses or mules, and survive. This little work deserves a place in any packer's library

books||5.0||Reading WAR AND PEACE is an immense undertaking, which has less to do with page numbers and more to do with addressing some very fundamental questions about what it means to be human. The first time that I read it, I read it as a novel, for entertainment. Years later, I picked it up again but this time my task was more ambitious. I sought to know how Tolstoy could justify the ways of God to man.  During this second reading, I was able to examine the Russian names, characters, events, and historical occurrences which occupied me the first time through. What I saw was that each of the hundreds of individuals was very much linked to the concluding Epilog, which I scanted then but studied now. Most readers of WAR AND PEACE find this part heavy going, which it certainly is, but in it, Tolstoy creates a key for unlocking the reasons who we are and why we do things the way we do. In essence, each human being is like an atom of gas floating in space, with one atom colliding at random with another, but when a sufficient number act in concert, such as Napoleon's invasion of Russia, their force is irresistable. When Tolstoy introduces world leaders like Napoleon or the Tsar, he does so in such a way as to depict them as no more than one more free floating atom, who can not see the Big Picture any more clearly than anyone else can.  The tragic decisions of these misguided leaders are based on a collective illusion that they and they alone can use divinely inspired reason to affect lasting change.  But when human beings act as if they acknowledge that their powers of reason are both limited and self-deluding--as when General Kutuzov relies on looking inward toward instinct rather than outward toward other circling and equally misguided atoms, then they are drawing closer to a universal "one" with nature.  This "one" Tolstoy invests with religious overtones as synonymous with God. Tolstoy does not say that human beings are preprogrammed robots held in thrall by that "one" or any other deity, but he does say that history, time, and man are all part of a universal flow that swoops along all in its path, and that if any intelligent atom wishes to know which way the flow is likely to go, then he might wish to emulate General Kutuzov, who at least knows that humbleness in the face of chaos is the first step in finding a rational basis for who we are and where we are going. 
books||5.0||As one of America's greatest presidents, Ronald Reagan will certainly be studied by historians for years to come and, like Abraham Lincoln he will likely be revered and discussed by people of all nationalities for many generations.  This book and his earlier autobiography, Where's the Rest of Me, will surely be the touch stones for any such inquiries and discussions.  This work, An American Life, however, will be of primary importance since it addresses his entire life and political career rather than simply the earlier part of his life, during which time he was primarily a sportscaster and actor.  For anyone who had the pleasure of listening to Reagan's political commentaries on the radio, or hearing him speak as Governor of California or as President of the United States, the book will be particularly enjoyable; for it is written in the easy-going conversational style that Reagan used in life.  What makes the book even more interesting is that you can not only catch a glimpse of the country into which Ronald Reagan was born but also see how that country was transformed into the nation as we know it today.  You may also observe that the problems of Reagan's day are not much different than those we face today.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone seeking to understand Ronald Reagan, how his many faceted character was formed, the inner workings of his mind, and the actions which led to his monumental achievements.  In my view, it would benefit the country greatly if this book was made to be required reading for every American child.

books||5.0||A fraudulent marine biologist, whose wife is about to expose his cover-up of phosphate pollution of the Florida Everglades, tries to kill her by throwing her overboard from a cruise ship.  Unknown to him she survives and haunts him to punish him. It's a wonderfully comic page-turner, although the plot runs out of steam towards the end and the practical jokes played on the would-be murderer become repetitious. A few ends are left loose. It challenged comparison with the Florida novels of Elmore Leonard, such as "Maximum Bob" and "Stick" but it does not quite live up to the master. Some of the humor contrasting weird and wacky Floridians with stolid Upper Midwesterners seemed to derive from David Barry (and Euripides, Ovid and Tasso used the maiden-rescued -from-sea-monster gimmick).I thought this was his best since "Striptease." The intervening ones have been too incoherently plotted and (although I'm a tree-hugging whale- lover myself) overloaded with environmentalist politics.  Incidentally, isn't releasing alien snake species into the wild an environmental no-no? 
books||2.0||The book's appearance and story line are both lighthearted and gentle with the underlying message that acceptance is the highest of all virtues. This approach will probably work for a typical 5 year old child in a Lesbian led household - especially a girl child. If the child is a boy and/or approachng 8 or 9 years old, the hard questions start coming and this book pretends these questions will never be asked.Doesn't everyone have a father, somewhere? Who is my father? What is he like? Where is he? Does he know about me? Does he care about me? Why don't I know? Why don't you know, Mommy?Mommy, when you grew up you lived with your Daddy, why don't I?When I grow up, should I live with a man or a woman? Why? How/when will I know? Does it matter? Is our family really a complete family if my father is unknown?I want to be a father some day. How do I learn what good fathers do?I love my friends and my dog;Does that make us a family?Think about it.  
books||1.0||This book was on somebody's Amazon.com LISTMANIA for Sea Turtles, so I hunted it down.  It is only vaguely about sea turtles, in that it is set on an island in Georgia where sea turtles nest.  There is a sea turtle biologist introduced at the very beginning of the book, and then he disappears, so it's obvious that he was involved in the crime. There are way too many characters in this book to keep track of and most of them are not believable or likable.  I wish this book had at least been fun to read but it was tedious and I ended up skimming the whole thing, looking for any sign of sea turtle interaction.  Skip this book and send your $6.99 to a sea turtle hospital instead.

We don't even get to see the hero and heroine meet and spend time together; the action starts after they've already spent a week getting to know each other. Very disappointing from a romance novel.And I don't really expect tightly woven mysteries in my romance novels, but the plot in this one defies belief. It's never explained why the first murder even occurs. The hero's fear that the murderer will focus on Venetia because she's using the last name "Jones" is beyond ludicrous. If that was going to be a major plot point, at least make it an unusual name that would link the hero and heroine together. But JONES?!All would be forgiven if the romance were compelling, but it wasn't in the slightest. I will probably choose to wait for the next one in paperback or at the library
books||1.0||Like everyone of you, I am crazy about my toddler.  I got this book and the book of Wendy S. Masi' Toddlers Play.  The comarison: day and night. Kuffners book might have 365 activities, but it really bad organized.  I am a first time parent, so I need some help/guidance; thsi is why I baught this bbok.  There is nothing to guide me on which activity is for what age group, so I don't know if an activity is for 18 months or 24 or 12 months- ie amI challenging my toddler, am I boring him or amI providing him with the right fun activity for his age??? Some of the activities are too obvious- it seems like the author wrote down anything she could think of just to fill in 365 activities in the bookl and there is you see the author's luck of creativity and/or knowledge of the subject.  Also the descriptiosn are very brief with limited illustrations.I really don't understand why anyone will give 5 stars to this book.  I don't care about the money I spent for the book.  I care that I ended up with something that I can not really use to provide my toddler with fun.  For that reason I strongly recommend the othe rbook (Wendy S. Masi's book).  Yes it has 100 instea dof 365 activities, but it is colorfull, easy and pleasant to read and each activity is marked by an ege indicator.  Look at the 'look inside' of both these books and you will see what I mean.Good luck + have lost of fun with your toddler(s)!!  
books||5.0||I first saw this book reviewed in the early 1990's. It aroused a double response of curiosity and suspicion. Like many a cynic I asked myself, "Now who's this guy and what's he spinning?" Against my natural inclination to dismiss it, I ordered POG. On receiving it I began reading and found my suspicions confirmed: here was another triumphal and insensitive adherent to the doctrine of the sovereignty of God.Strangely, however, I couldn't stop reading. Despite months of scrawling angry counter-arguments in the margins of its pages I was drawn inexplicably to the sensibility of its core premise about God's delight in being God. To make this story short, I found myself, in the end, exhausted but surrendered to the portrait of God that Piper paints with the full palette of scriptural truth. And finally happy too, with the beginnings of the joy Piper wished for his sons in the Foreword.Salvation history testifies to the fact that a distinguishing evidence of the truth is that it is often hated - at first. The fact that POG eventually had such an unnatural (or supernatural) effect on someone like me - initially so inclined to resist and rebuff - speaks more to the validity of this book than if I had joined immediately in the chorus of deserved admiration.This is not a critical analysis of POG; others have provided that sufficiently on this page. Instead it's a personal account of the Irresistible Grace that against all nature drew a small and scoffing soul into undeserved open spaces where God's glory was seen...and is now sung.
books||2.0||...you can waste your time and save your money by checking this out of your local library.If you want to get an "inside view" of the inner workings of Wall Street during the excessive gyrations of the '80s, then read Den of Theives - that book is well written and well worth the money!What turned me off about this book was the structure and the writing style.  The first half of the book was essentially the author relating fortuitous circumstances that were the product of Serendipity.  He was simply in the right place at the right time, had virutally no idea how he got there, felt out of place the whole time (even when he was raking in the Big Bucks in NY and London), and so now he thought he'd wwrite a book about it.  I also got the sense that he was trying to assuage some guilt from his association at Salomon Brothers.  He was there, he made a lot of money, good for him - get over it!I was also pretty disappointed because the subject matter has A LOT more potential.  I might have actually enjoyed it - had I not read Den of Theives 7 years earlier, and already had some idea of how things took place.  But, if you can get it for $5 or less (including shipping), and you have little to no knowledge of what an investment banker's life is like (and you haven't also seen the movie Wall Street (which covers the same highlights in this book)), then it's probably worth it.I did like the wrap up he did towards the end of the book, relating where he had heard everyone from the firm ended up...althought that seemed a little rushed..
books||5.0||This book is about yoga for the heart, which is rare in our body sculpting culture, yet paradoxically heart diseases are one of the greatest risk factors for our modern health. A simple, profound gift of yoga is the  recognition that the body is the temple for the indwelling spirit.  Realizing this simple truth profoundly affects our relationship to the  body. Through the author's lifetime committment to the teachings of yoga,  we glimpse the relevance of the yogic lifestyle. This book serves as a  guide in making healthier choices in everyday life. By walking for awhile  with Nischala, we touch a deeper realization of the unity that yoga brings.  I recommend this book to any yoga practitioner, teacher, as well as anyone  who seeks greater peace of mind and physical well-being
books||1.0||A disappointing book about a fabulous story.  The book reads as if it was pasted together from press cuttings and, if you look at the chapter notes, this appears to be how it was researched.There are little irritants, such as referring to Steve Jobs as "Steve" as if he's a close friend, but the big problem is that it recounts a number of interesting incidents in Steve Jobs' career while missing the main story.  And what a fantastic story that is.  I hope that someone has written a decent account of Steve Jobs' life because I would like to read it.  One thing is certain: "iCon" sure ain't it.
books||2.0||A friend going through the same problems as I am was strongly recommended this book by her therapist and she bought it for me, as well.  I was enthusiastic to read it and at least understand these emotions.  If I could actually use the information to help myself, all the better.  I was warned that the beginning was a bit slow and hard to get through, so I struggled through it, expecting it to get easier to read.  It didn't.  It's been sitting by my bed for months with the bookmark at page 104 and I'm really sorry because I'm sure that the contents are useful and interesting, but I just can't get past that page 104.  I normally refuse to leave a book half unread, but this just has to be an exception because every time I pick it up I fall asleep within 3 or 4 pages.I agree with some of the previous reviewers that there is way too much emphasis on the actual workings of the meetings.  I feel like I'm watching a video of it, as every minimal thing is described in incredible detail.  But I wanted to read this book to understand the views and conclusions of the group, not to become an expert on the tea breaks they had.  Also, I felt lost as the scientific tests they had previously carried out were explained in such detail, I ended up having to skim over some sections.This may be a great resource for those who have great patience and/or a scientific background, but too much for a regular Joe like me

However, the topics that it covers are highly efficient in helping you advance with your programming skills. They might not quite be what you'd expect from a PHP book, because actually Schlossnagle covers  anything that is needed to work with PHP on a professional level.Consider this list of topics:- Write clean code- OO-Design Patterns- Project documentation- Performance tuningsThis is all not really PHP-only stuff, but it is a great source of inspiration and furthers the understanding of programming in general very much. The latter I find is necessary for everybody who's up to something bigger in PHP.The PHP examples in the book are - I have to admit - maybe sometimes rather scarce. One would like to see more applications of abstract problems, more examples. But is that what a book is for, to give examples?I don't think so. For me a book is mainly a source of great ideas from great programmers, anything else is available on the web.After having bought "Advanced PHP Programming" I purchased other books, the topics of which I would not have considered without reading Schlossnagle's work. I'm just about to write a diploma work and the book is a great reference for anything concerning PHP and development projects

books||5.0||Hal Zina Bennett's profound advice from his prolific writing career (over 30 published books) is, "write from the heart".  As wonderful as that sounds, most writers know it's not an easy thing to do.  	Hal takes us to another dimension by sharing his personal process and showing each of us how we can remove the blocks to our expression and creativity by learning how to speak from our heart to the heart of our reader. I can speak from my own personal experience, having attended his workshops and received personal counselling from him in the process of writing my book, "Sacred Woman, Sacred Dance:  Awakening Spirituality Through Movement and Ritual". 	"Write From the Heart" also offers practical guidance in several areas.  This includes such things as the need for solitude.  However, he is not just talking about having "a quiet space", he goes beyond the physical to the inner - a state of mind.  He says, "Once we know what it is, what it looks like and feels like, we can create it for ourselves, almost--I say "almost"--regardless of where we happen to be."  	I would certainly recommend this book to anyone writing for personal expression or looking to be published
books||5.0||Bruce Schneier offers an excellent 'big picture' overview of the computer security field. From types of attacks, to algorithm security to security in the context of your data center, you get a full overview of the current practices and consequences arising from them. The author argues for security as a process, not a product; security is not something you can add to your product after the fact. Starting from the product specification, down to your last outsourced programmer, security has to permeate your organization for it to work. Building 'attack trees', relying on peer review and enforcing liability are all suggestions advanced by Bruce Schneier. Secrets and Lies is a well organized book with plenty of real world examples, problems and solutions. Buy a copy for yourself, and many more for everybody else you know, we will all benefit in the end.

From the first page I began to re-live the entire bonding rituals that we had experienced over that weekend.  How to connect, how to communicate, and how to intimately bond on a higher plane!  Although some of the prose is repetitive, it helps instill a spiritual base on which the reader can pull from. A definite "must have" book for the gay tribe who would like to interact spiritually and emotionally

books||2.0||I heard about this book growing up but didn't read it until just recently (a middle-aged adult) and I have to agree with so many other reviewers who feel its popularity largely stems from the time period in which it was written, i.e., it was SO SHOCKING AND DISGUSTING! Such filth! I mean, that's why I heard about the book when I was growing up. But as so many others have already pointed out, it is tame by today's standards. I also have to agree with another reviewer who wrote that the "female protagonist is completely a male fantasy. The book's message is simply that men like women who are able to climax at the same time as their partners without any need for foreplay or other effort on the man's part..." Now, you see, what struck me about Sir Clifford's situation, and Lady Chatterley's, for that matter, is if they really loved each other, his paralysis from the waist down wouldn't have had to put a stop to his supplying her with orgasms; there ARE other things that can be done, yes? In fact, quite possibly Connie would have had an orgasm for the first time! (Ahem, women readers will know what I mean.) But Clifford treated Connie poorly. With or without the lack of sex issue, I think she would have been emotionally open to an affair anyway. Which to me, just goes to show that a man wrote the book...a man totally out of touch with what really makes a woman tick.

But a recent trip to the Middle East and growing hobby collecting ancient coins had left me lost and confused as I tried to put in context  the ruins visited and the coins I collected. With time, the names of cities  and regions change so that one needs a separate map for each period.   Morkot's superbly written historical atlas not only provides maps, but the  rationale and context for their evolution and change. One of the best  features in the structure of this book is the use of the overview, followed  by a series of in-depth accounts, each from the perspective of the  important "players" during a given historical period.  This  approach is immensely effective in reinforcing the information since the  same information is repeated and new information added as each of the  regions, their politics and battles, are succesively presented.  From the  Mycenae to the Parthians are thousands of years, thousands of miles, and  thousands of political entities whose ebb and flow of power and reach of  influence affect us even today. For the first time after years of puzzling  over strange Grecian place names and leaders, I am now able to begin to  understand the who what when and where for the 5 millenia preceding the  birth of Christ.  I wish this had been the first book I read in my study of  ancient history.  I can hardly wait to start on Penguin's sequel - Acient  Rome
books||2.0||I bought this book to try to learn some useful poses for my subjects, and given most other people's ratings, I decided to give it a try.  However, upon opening the book my first thought was, "these all look like high school yearbook photos", which is exacltly what they are.  It seems that that's primarily what type of photography the author does and his book is geared almost exclusively to that market.  His main concern, which he stresses throughout the book, is creating a "saleable picture", and he keeps emphasizing the importance of pleasing mom, since she's usually the one with final say over the pictures.  A better title for this book would have been, "How To Take High School Senior Pictures".Even then, most of the pictures are not very good, both in their original execution and in their print quality for this book. In addition, the poses are unnatural and awkward looking, and the book is filled with typos and grammatical errors.To be fair, the author does suggest some useful basics of things to do and things not to do when posing a subject, but there is really very little useful information here.So, if you're interested in learning how to take pictures that look like a Sears portrait, this may be the book for you.  However, if you really want to learn some useful techniques for posing your subjects in a more natural or more artistic manner, I'd steer clear of this book
books||5.0||Here is a book written for literally anyone who wants to learn lessons for life on how to get rich. And for all those desperados out there dreaming of getting fantastically rich with ridiculously little effort: here is your guide. You will learn that making money and getting rich isn't hard at all, but it requires a little discipline. There are only a handful of tips given in this book, but they are sufficient to make a real difference in your wallet and a real difference in your life!The style is very easy to understand and very straight-forward. A child could read this book, even though the setting is that of the ancient city of Babylon, but that makes the story and the lesson all the more interesting. Five stars are awarded to this book and trust me, you'll agree with me
books||5.0||	'Conservatives Without Conscience' does nothing less than expose the matrix of political illusion with a comprehensive framework of science.  There is much more that could be said about the authoritarian character structure and the history of the science, but John Dean does a good job of explaining the basics, and how it applies to our modern political landscape. 	 This is not new information, it has just been sequestered in the hands of academics and the Carl Rove wing of the Republican party.  The academics keep measuring and refining their understanding, and Carl Rove and his party keeps using the information to manipulate the american public.  Finally, someone mainstream has laid it out for all to see.  Knowledge is power, so everyone should read his book.  However, one lesson to be learned from this book is that closed mindedness is a hallmark trait of the authoritarian character, so this is not a book written to convert anyone with strong authoritarian character traits.  They don't tend to read books much anyway.  It is a book  for the open minded, that will put into context our mean spirited political landscape,  the by any means necessary tactics of many named players, and the proto-fascist movement that has hijacked our country. 	John Dean pulls no punches.  He names names and kicks butt.  He gets a little dry when trying to define his wing of conservatism as opposed to neo conservatism, but even that is well worth the effort.  If you have a shred of unease about the leaders of the Republican party and those who  unquestionably support them, then read this book.  It is an eye opener

books||5.0||Alan Lightman is one of those rare individuals who has a solid background in both physics and the humanities.  As a result, he has been able to write this very enjoyable collection of essays dealing with the human context of science, especially physics.  None of the essays are ultra profound, but they're still insightful enough to make worthwhile reading, especially considering that the amount of literature in this genre is fairly limited.  This book reminds me of "Feynman's Rainbow" by Leonard Mlodinow, which I also found to be very enjoyable and, like Mlodinow's book, Lightman's book is a quick read.As other reviewers have noted, the specific essay topics are a mixed bag including autobiography, biography, the relationship between math and physics, the nature and experience of scientific inquiry, and other broader topics such as the influence of technology in human life.As indicated in my title, if you have at least a popular-level familiarity with modern physics, and can also appreciate the humanities, I predict that you will find this book to be quite enjoyable, and perhaps also somewhat enlightening.  I enjoyed reading the book, and I expect that I will read it again in the future
books||5.0||Ed Hayes exposes himself and one might think that the machine gun style of the book is fantasy but it doesn't do justice to the man himself. His dedication to his clients is legendary and he spends every working moment thinking and working for them. Having shared some of his adventures but as a cop,I found that he loves cops. If it wasn't for the fact that he would not have been able to support his interesting lifestyle he would have been one.His book covers his life and gives a glimpse into the man and his style. He doesn't know how to go at half speed and neither does the book. His upfront approach is evident. He just doesn't have time for B.S.It's a quick read and an enjoyable one. Make sure that you take it with you on vacation! It will make it more enjoyable
books||4.0||This book gives very good advice about managing behavior problems in difficult children. However, the concept of a "strong-willed child" is confusing because it implies a child with will power or self control. These difficult children actually have poor will power and self control. The techniques given in this book will help teach such children self control.It is important to understand that the cause of the strong-willed child is an excessive drive for power over others. The strong willed child wants to be Captain and he wants everyone else including his parents to be a deck hand.  Parenting this type of child correctly, will help him learn to better control himself and respect others. However, he will likely never be the compliant child that some parents are hoping for.  [...
books||1.0||A biography about a boy - and a very tough and brave one - who was in battle for such a short time he was spared the continuous horror that veteran survivors (or killed and maimed) of Iwo experienced. He saved the wounding or death of the three other members of his fire team in an apparently instinctive and singular act of self sacrifice. By strict definition, this act was deserving of the Medal of Honor. His terribly painful recovery from wounds received is heart wrenching, but the relatively odd sense of personal glory is in sharp contrast with other accounts of Iwo veterans, or any other battle, I have read. The other accounts I have read generally conclude: War is a horrible thing to experience, and not glorious, but "I would do it again.........".The recent books I have read will illustrate this contrast:"GOODBYE, DARKNESS", William Manchester"GOD IS NOT HERE.....", Richard Overton"THE QUIET HERO", Gary W. Toyn"FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS", James Bradley"THE LAST LIEUTENANT", John ShivelyThese men may have entered combat as boys, but they certainly left as men.
books||5.0||The late Ed McBain left all mystery buffs a lasting legacy with his 87th Precinct novels but a worthy addition to this legacy is The Gutter And The Grave. Written in 1958, this hardboiled gem has been all but forgotten. But thanks to Hard Case Crime, a new generation can experience this incredible early work from one of the all-time masters. The hero, Cordell, is as tragic and harboiled as they come as he, soaked in cheap booze, wallows in the memory of an unfaithful wife. Until a favor for a friend draws him into a web of murder and deception. It seems everyone is lying and each lie twists the tail in new directions, leaving the reader's head spinning. The novel features McBain's usually excellent dialogue, the setting is well-drawn featuring the jazz scene in 1950's New York. There's humor, pathos, some great fights and enough broken dreams to fill Broadway. This little gem of a novel has been unavailable for far too long. I give it my highest recommendation. Fantastic!  
books||5.0||Those interested in American art of the last century will find great pleasure in reading this book. Chicago and New York are the centers from which Katharine Kuh radiated. As a museum curator, art dealer, and published critic, she was personally close to many of the modern masters. In this book, she provides short but telling stories about their work and lives. I especially liked the chapters on Rothko, Tobey and Noguchi.Disparate side characters, such as Judge Learned Hand and LBJ, pop up and add further to the value of Ms. Kuh's memoir. Avis Berman has done a great service to all those interested in the history of twentieth century American art by completing the memoirs of Katharine Kuh. The author's reflections have been preserved in a form, while still true to the author, that is likely better than had the elderly Ms. Kuh herself remained alive to complete the job. Notes to the text and a more complete description of Katharine Kuh's personal background are some of the very much-appreciated work accomplished by Ms. Berman
books||5.0||How does she do it? This will forever be one of my favorite books. Reading about the astoundingly crazy life Mary Karr had as a child made me wonder how her sense of humor could be so sharp and perfect and still get across the sadness and pathos without making me feel bad or hopeless. Nor did I feel that she was in a hopeless situation. It always seemed as though there were morsels of goodness somewhere to be found. A profoundly inspiring book. I only hope I can be as resourceful and resilient
books||5.0||Add this reviewer to the list of people who hold Paradise Lost up to the lofty title of The Greatest Epic Poem in the English Language; it is not only this, but one of the best in any language. Writing unabashedly in the tradition of unrhymed Homeric epic verse, Mitlon was working well within what was earlier purveyed by Homer, Virgil, and Dante -- but he brings his own distinctive touch and flair to the work. The opening lines of the long poem are clearly inspired by Homer, as are other elements, but Milton has a very unique poetic style; long sentences, often with the principle verb at the end, being one of its mainstays. This language is very grandiose and quite complex; it takes a while to get used to it -- you will have to pay very close attention during the first book -- but, as with most classical literature, once the reader gets the hang of it, it goes quite smoothly. The Divine Comedy of Dante has a more towring reputation than does Milton's Paradise Lost -- for one thing, it is older -- but I among those who find Milton to be superior. The Divine Comedy is, certainly, an undisputed masterpiece, but, where it was, more or less, a satire and a thinly-veiled attack on many of Dante's political enemies, Milton's work deals with much more complex and profound subject matter:  why mankind fell, how the gods themselves operate and think, the nature and attractiveness of evil and sin, the importance of love in human relationships, the moral problems of God's justice. It is true that Dante's work is more original; Paradise Lost and Paradise Regained, at least in seed, come straight from The Bible. But Milton only uses these stories as a springboard for the exploration of the latent moral and ethical problems lurking beneath. Milton explores these problems with a refreshingly fresh perspective -- strictly within the Christian tradition, to be sure, but far from fundamentalist, and even quite radical for its day. Although some cite the work as Christian apologist, there are certainly many elements within the poem that many of the more hard-line Christians would be taken aback by; it was, of course, even more controversial in its day. One thing about the work that often gets pointed out is that Satan is a far more interesting and appealing character than God. This, in my view, does not have Milton unwittingly on the Devil's side, as some critics have suggested. Rather, he is pointing out how appealing sin is always is:  of course it's interesting, of course it's appealing -- otherwise, we wouldn't keep falling for it again and again and again. If we saw its razor-sharp fangs and [dripping] mouth, we would have stopped getting ensnared in its trap long ago. However, as a non-Christian myself, I cannot but disagree with some points of Milton's theodicy; the last two books, in particular, and Paradise Regained as a whole, were, for me, quite hard to swallow. I found the more human elements of the poem to be its most intriguing. Milton paints Adam and Eve as quintissentially human characters who possess many of the same feelings that we all share:  joy, happiness, fear, sadness, depression, and, most of all, the overriding paramount importance of love. The act of Adam, who was not himself [evil], eating of the apple so that he could follow Eve, no matter what doom was to befall her and them, out of love for her, is still one of the most touching moments in all of literature -- as Mark Twain, in the voice of Adam, later said, "Wheresoever Eve was there, THERE was Eden." God, Satan, and the various angels are also endowed with human characteristics; most Christians today seem to have forgotten that God created Man "in His own image", and that He is not a perfect creature. Likewise, Satan is not entirely evil -- certainly he is ambitious and narcissistic, but so are many humans -- indeed, many have seen him as the hero of the poem (an errorenous view, as I see it.) God often comes off as extremely cold and hardly forgiving or merciful; indeed, to many readers, myself included, this poem doesn't come anywhere near its stated goal of justifying the ways of Gods to men, but only reinforces the views we already had (Mark Twain, whom I have previously mentioned, has a very different view of the situation, closer to my own perspective, that is worth seeking out.) Whatever one's objections to the theology and theodicy expressed within the poem, the poem remains a great work of literature -- poetic, grandiose, profound, extremely readable, and thought-provoking. The shorter sequel, Paradise Regained, is also included in this edition. This work, in my view, comes nowhere near the glory of it's predecessor, but it is still a good read and it is very handy to have it included in this volume as well. For that reason, I highly reccommend picking up this particular edition of the works; also because the introduction, written by Dr. Susanne Woods, is very good, and it has notes provided by the wonderful Christoper Ricks, who also edited the poem for this version. Unlike many editors, he does not include so many notes that they become cumbersome and distract from the text:  they are genuinely helpful and there are not too many of them. This is an absolute classic not only of English literature, but of world literature, and a monument in the tradition of epic poetry that you owe it to yourself to read

I am an educated, well travelled adult who while born in the United States, spent a good portion of my childhood living overseas and consider myself to be fairly open minded.  To be called a communist, a traitor, and an enemy of America just because I don't buy into the ultra conservative mind think is an insult to the freedom that this country was founded on.I have never in my life considered buring or destroying a book because of it's evil, until I read this one.Be afraid, be very afraid of these people
books||1.0||If you look at the March 2004 issue of the International Association of Bloodstain Pattern Analysts, you'll find a very negative review of this book. Given that the reviewer (Herbert Leon MacDonell, the Director of Laboratory of Forensic Science  Bloodstain Institute of Corning, New York) and all members of IABPA actively work in the field of forensics, I'd take their word for it. Here's an excerpt from the review, which can be found on the web at http://www.iabpa.org/March2004News.pdf"Many fine books have been written on the general subject of forensic science but this is not one of them. It only takes reading the first page for the reader to discover that this book is not going to be a source of accurate forensic information." The reviewer goes on to say:"...the frightening aspect is that lay persons who purchase such garbage are unaware of how inaccurate the things they are reading really are. It is unfortunate that there are publishers out there who will print a manuscript without having some form of peer review to determine whether there are a few minor errors or is it so bad like this book, that they should trash it.
books||4.0||"Lords of the Earth" is the term the Yali warriors use to describe themselves.  They live in the Heluk valley in Irian Jaya, and the only knowledge of them to reach the outside world are the dark rumors of the cannibals beyond the mountains.  The first section of the book is about them, their customs, and the awful fear and darkness they lived in.  Don Richardson does a great job portraying a people bound by chains of sin, and longing for release.  The horror of their pain is graphic, and not suitable to be read to younger children.  The second part of the book describes the early life of Stan Dale, his conversion, and his burden for those in darkness.  He is drawn as a determined man, physically strong and fit, with firm convictions.  The book goes on to tell of Stan's coming to the Yali people.  How a strange story begins over his identity, protecting his life.  How the first few Yali Christians were killed, and later Stan and a fellow missionary were brutally murdered.  How another missionary family died in a plane crash, except for the nine-year-old son, whose friendship with the Yali paves the way for them to turn to Christ.  The book reminded me Christ's words in John 12:24, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit."  On earth, Stan Dale never saw the fruit his life and death brought forth, but he will rejoice in heaven with the Yali that are there through his witness.  
books||5.0||This book is more dated than THE SECRET GARDEN, but it's still a great story. It's hard NOT to identify with Sara Crewe.I loved this book as a child (though not as much as I loved THE SECRET GARDEN, which I think is a better book). However, A LITTLE PRINCESS may appeal more to some people; some readers may find the story stronger and the main character, Sara Crewe, more likable. Sara's determination to stay herself despite how other people treat her and view her is inspiring and may help readers through tough times of their own. Some scenes (I don't want to spoil the surprise by describing them) are magical.  A LITTLE PRINCESS is a great story that makes readers think. Some of those thoughts make you uncomfortable, like the thoughts about differences between rich and poor children - but that (I think) is part of the book's greatness. Be sure to get an unabridged edition: this book is beautifully written and should not be simplified. Kids now CAN read and will love this book: at least, every girl to whom I have given a copy has read it and reread it -- on her own.For a modern, well-written book about another girl at an English boarding school, read Libby Koponen's BLOW OUT THE MOON. It has the same classic feel, though American heroine is very different from Sara in some ways (though she too is determined to hang onto her identity) and MOON is quite funny
books||4.0||Woodward and Bernstein, famous reporters for the Washington Post during the Watergate scandal, chronicle their experience investigating and exposing the deceptive actions of President Nixon and his cronies during Watergate.  This book takes the reader through Woodward and Bernstein's efforts at uncovering the truth, internal dilemmas about the information they were uncovering, and covert meetings with confidential sources.  They tell a tale of mystery and intrigue that stands up to some of the world's best fiction except that this story actually happened and signaled the end of an era where the US Presidency was respected above all else.This book is a fascinating look at how investigative journalism once was.  Instead of printing first and asking questions later, Woodward and Bernstein, along with their editors, took painstaking efforts at checking, double checking, and even triple checking their sources and information before putting something derogatory in print.  It seems a sharp contrast to journalism today that appears to be publish now, ask questions later, and file a retraction in small print even later.  This book also tells the tale of two very opposite reporters and how they pulled together to write about the crime spree of the century and topple a corrupt Presidency.  It gets better with each reading
books||2.0||Not only do I disagree with his opinions, but some of his facts are blatently false.  On page 106 he refers to violence agains Native Americans by European settlers as "isolated instances" and not planned nor calculated.  Had to read it for a class and it was less then enjoyable

books||1.0||.... you can get all three of these wacky books in one neat volume! Doesn't this hurt the bottom line at Hagee Ministries? What, has the pool of his mesmerized followers begun to dry up? It reminds me of when the band, KISS (aka Kings In Satan's Service) re-packaged their first three albums as "The Originals." At least in that case you had an extra track of "Rock and Roll All Nite", assuming you already had the album "Dressed To Kill." On the other hand, maybe Hagee Ministries was using the KISS model, assuming that it wouldn't hurt to have his drivel repeated in one handy, compact volume of fear
books||2.0||The prologue of this book lead me to believe this was going to be a very touching love story of a woman losing the love of her life and finding love again.  I was disappointed, soon after, when it turned into a gardening manual and a tale about ghosts, with a sort of haphazard romance thrown in the middle-and then even that was disappointing.  I mean Graceland for a first date?  I noticed a lot of similarities between Roz and the mayor in Northern Lights, and Logan and Nate from that same book.  None of them can talk in complete sentences.  And Stella, who comes across as this loving mother, who puts her kids before anything else, works from sun up to sun down and is so smug that she thinks the whole business is going to come crashing down around everybody if she isn't there to oversee everything, even though the place has been successful for years.  There is no addressing the issue of moving on with her life after the death of her husband, she just does it. Unless, of course, it was in the last 50 pages which I didn't bother to read because I just couldn't torture myself any longer.  And I'm a big fan of Roberts.  I love her Quinn brothers books and a lot of her other work.  But this just stunk because I could really care less who the ghost is going to turn out to be.  I'm certainly not going to suffer through the last two books to find out.
books||1.0||While the author rehashes some basic business writing theory, she consistently fails to follow her own rules:- The text is full of fluff- The style is flippant instead of useful- The lecture style puts you to sleep There are much better books on the subject. A textbook approach is necessary for this subject. Not this dopey-run-on-crap.
books||2.0||This book was selected by my book club. I had never read Anna Quindlen before.  Rise and Shine was a disappointment to me.  I kept hoping that Meghan would somehow be redeemed, but that did not happen.  She is really not very likeable.  I thought there would have been more of a dialog between the sisters concerning Leo's tradgedy.  Meghan blamed her sister in one line and then it was never brought up again.  The book left me with an empty feeling.  It was not a satisfying read
books||5.0||Thank you, Dr. Null, for holistically addressing the health concerns that are predominant in women.  The politics behind female healthcare are shocking and frightening.  You put it all into perspective within these  covers.    You also saved me from the quandary of what to buy all the women  in my family for Christmas.   You're insightful and have a wealth of  helpful information.   Bless you
books||4.0||Jane Hirshfield and Mariko Aratani have done a marvelous job with the translation of these lovely tanka-- manages to capture both their fragility and robust complexity. I had a friend who was a Japanese scholar, who explained to me once the complexity of translating waka. I have nothing but admiration for those who can do it well. Hirshfield actually has an essay at the back of this book called "On Japanese Poetry and the Process of Translation". I recommend it highly, even if you do not normally read this kind of essay.I am a little bit afraid that the focus on the love poems and the emphasis on Ono no Komachi and Izumi Shikibu as female writers may give the wrong idea about the strength and importance of the poetry. Shikibu is widely considered the greatest poet of her period and Ono no Komachi was one of the Rokkasen-- the six best waka poets of the early Heian period. The reason that I am not giving this volume five stars is because of this packaging and not because of the poetry itself.These poems are a joy to read aside from any issues of scholarship. They are strong and sad and very affecting. There is actually no stronger recommendation to read this than the poems themselves, so I will close this review with one of the poems by Shikibu:What is the useof cherishing life in spring?Its flowersonly shackle usto this world
books||1.0||Don't sell it to one country on microfilm for a lot of money, sell it to everybody in hard cover for ~$20.00 a pop.   Somebody is going to have to explain to me the difference between what Risen has done here, and what the Walkers were imprisoned for.Imagine a WWII era reporter, during the war, giving away that the Allies had broken the Kreigsmarine Enigma code in order to challenge how much money was spent doing it; or how we used false signals to test Japanese intentions in the run-up to Midway just to question whether we correctly evaluated the information; or disclosed the exact D-day landing beaches in a vain attempt to substitute their own "expert" opinion.  James Risen's product is the same thing, only with a snarkier Monday-morning-quarterback vibe.  And when hindsight is your only insight, you know you're in trouble.  It's easy to figure out who had it right on intelligence issues a few years down the line, even easier to find the "I-told-you-so heroes" eager to tell their tales of cassandrian victimization.   And that's really all State of War does.  It collects a pile of disconnected (often single-sourced and anonymous) anecdotes, and fleshes them out.  The more interesting the story, the more questionably it's sourced, and the fuller its fleshed.  In the end, it's a bloated yet vacuous work that discloses sensitive specifics in order to illustrate a few widely known and obvious generalities, those being:      Intelligence gathering isn't perfect.        Mistakes are often made.        Present laws do not keep up with technology.        (Just in case you didn't know that already) If you're hoping for an across the board Bush slam, think twice.  There's info on botched Clinton-era operations as well (one of which transferred nuclear weapons technology to one of our favorite Mid-East regimes), but again, why?  What's worse, the specifics in the book have given terrorists valuable intelligence without giving anyone else anything usable (Unless cocktail party whining is a "use").  In the wake of this book and the politically-motivated NY Times story, the bad guys have already started altering how they do their communications.  Great news for American civilians and military members alike.   This book might have a place 10-20 years down the line.  But as it stands, during an active shooting war, a valuable, effective, and completely legal intelligence gathering tool (a tool Clinton used with "0" congressional oversight) is revealed and disabled so that James Risen can buy a boat.  Another triumph of American journalism!
books||1.0||"Col Mike Martin" raised in Iraq, speaks fluent arabic.........The Taliban are Pashtoon, they are not arabs, they don't speak arabic, they don't even like arabs very much. They are a totaly closed tribal society. I spent a year living and working with the Pashtoon in 2005 in Helmand Province. There are no members of the Taliban who are not Pashtoon. The other ethnic groups in Afghanistan, the Tajik and the Hazara, are opposed to the Taliban.Mike Martin would not have the correct family, clan and tribal ties and background to carry this off.Sorry, but Forsythe has dropped the ball on this one.
books||2.0||This book provides a good overview of blacks (slave and free) in New York. It's a very good reference (encyclopedic) book.My main problem with it is that Leslie M. Harris, the author, relies heavily (if not entirely) on secondary sources. The book, then, is nothing more than a patchwork of various other more scholarly works. Hence, finding the actual primary source (i.e. court decision, council minutes, etc) proves extremely difficult.I do not recommend this book for advanced students. If, however, you're interested in an easy read and don't care about sources, this is the book for you
books||2.0||Sure, I had fun reading this book.  But the Amazon reviewer who termed it "highly speculative" is understating the case.  Opinion, conjecture, hearsay, and speculation too often take the place of thorough, solid documentation.  And unlike many other Amazon reviewers, I found McLellan's tone off-putting.  She alternates between patronizing her subjects (the very notion of calling them "my girls," for instance) and setting them up primarily as sources of voyeuristic thrills for the herself and the reader.  Is the book dishy and intriguing and flamboyant?  You bet.  But is the topic of lesbianism in Hollywood well-served here?  I don't think so
books||4.0||Kate White introduces us to the world of tabloid reporting in a sassy titillating crime novel--Over Her Dead Body. I could feel the slime drip off the characters that were responsible for keeping the Buzz and its rag competitors in production. While the mention of 'current' celebrities will date this book, Kate's spellbinding storytelling definitely has staying power. Over Her Dead Body is a fast-paced novel about the murder of the Mona Hodges, Editor in Chief of the Buzz, who had a long list of hostages in her wake, each one having good reason to hate her or perhaps kill her-with a sprinkling of romance for levity. Even though the main character, Bailey Weggins, a celebrity crime writer, gets discombobulated many times throughout the investigation, she is clever enough to pull together the pieces of the mystery to its conclusion. Right to the end Kate White keeps the reader guessing on who did this horrible crime. I am looking forward to reading more Bailey Weggins' mysteries. Don't keep us waiting, Kate!Armchair Interviews says: Sounds like another good summer read.
books||2.0||This was my first reading of Jamaica Kincaid. She has a short, concise style, which made me often feel like I was reading poetry. However, I felt that it also had some downsides, like stifling character growth. In Lucy, the title character comes to America to be an nanny for a rich couple with four young daughters. Lucy watches as their marriage crumbles and tries to avoid turning into her own mother, who for some reason she hates. I wish we knew a bit more about Lucy, like why she hated her homeland so much. It was  an alright quick read, but had it been longer, I doubted it would have held my attention
books||1.0||An elf appearing to Harry Potter warned him not to return for a second year to the school of sorcery. The Chamber of Secrets, he said, had been opened and a  monster is lurking. Harry goes anyway and is the only one who can hear the monster, challenge it and save students who have been "petrified" by the monster. Age group interest: early teen. I wanted to see what all the rave was about. Lots of action, not much morale.Trish New, author of The Thrill of Hope, South State Street Journal
books||5.0||The most gorgeous artwork in comic books. Contains the most extraordinary artwork of Alex Ross(Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman,  the Justice League, etc, even Hanna-Barbera!) A comics fan, I recieved this as a Christmas gift, and I read it again and again.A must-have for comic book fans.
books||2.0||Not a bad beach read but nothing in this story is unexpected. I didn't really connect with the main characters. I was interested by the description in the supernatural aspects (the lights) it seemed like a mystery/love story that may have been unique but instead was a way too predictable love story.
books||5.0||Wow! This is a wonderful reference book not only for Taiji Jian (tai chi sword), but also for Taiji Quan. All sections of the book are straight forward and easy to follow. There wasn't any mystical "mumbo jumbo" I couldn't comprehend. The first chapter which gives the reader information about the history of the Taiji jian, I particlularly liked this historical information. Chapter two is for Taiji jian and Tai Chi Quan practitioners. This chapter explains clearly the "ins and outs" of Taiji Quan and Taiji jian. The author explains basic trainning, principles, elements, etc. I found this section of great interest to me having only studied Taiji Quan for about a year now. I believe the information I've gainned from reading this section will help improve my practice.I think advanced practitioners will find chapter two valuable as well. The remaining chapters 3-8 give the reader information on the parts of the jian, how to practce with the jian, basic movements,fighting principles, and a 32 posture form with pictures and detailed explanations. The explaination of each picture includes info about the key points, internal components and the movement itself. This is a great manual that I know I will refer to over and over again. This is a must read book for any Taiji Quan or Taiji jian practitioner
books||5.0||This fiction of a plot against American Jews is very interesting. It is well written and it holds your attention. The little boy telling the story and the intricacy of politics attached to the story make this novel a book you cannot put aside. This is about an era of American history, and it is well documented. I recommend it to everyone: the older generation who lived thru it and particularly to the younger generation of people who are not familiar with this period; it teaches that history is constantly in the remake and cultural differences are still a problem in our world.
books||1.0||I am an avid reader and have never once submitted a book review.  However, after reading Botox Diaries, I felt compelled to write and warn you all that this book is dull, trite, and disjointed.  I love my "chick-lit" books, but Botox Diaries is a disgrace to this genre.  The plot is weak and unrealistic (even in light of the suspended disbelief one normally affords "lite & fun" books).  The plot is also disjointed, perhaps because two authors co-wrote this book.  The characters are shallow and excruciatingly dull.  Botox Diaries is absolutely the worst book I have ever read. -- December 2005 Update:  My friend insisted on reading this book (ugh...despite my warnings!). Even though she was stuck in the airport for eight hours, she still couldn't bear to finish the book, because she found it so dull. She actually left it, half-read, at the airport
books||2.0||While this book put together by the Detroit Free Press has action photos, they are some of the most disappointing pictures i've ever seen in a book about a team's season. Where are the photos of Tiger players actually hitting a baseball? If you want to see photos of players celebrating and covered in champagne, talking to fans and media and blowing bubbles, then this is the book for you but if you want to see some actual fine baseball action shots from the diamond itself, be prepared to be frustrated. I much preferred the photograhy in the George Cantor paperback "Out of Nowhere" The Detroit Tigers' Magical 2006 Season. I know that this volume covers the Play-offs and World Series whereas the Cantor book doesn't, but it's photo collection is poor, the photos in the Cantor book are superb. If you are a Tiger fan you may enjoy this book very much, (the writing and articles are quite good at least)but my enjoyment was spoilt somewhat by hardly any pictures of Tiger players hitting baseballs or fielding grounders etc. Very disappointing, worth only 2 stars
books||1.0|| Dawn written by Elie Wiesel is a story about two men who aremeant to be killed at the same time, at dawn. David Ben Moshe is Jewish and will be killed by the English at the same time as Elisha; a Jewish man will kill an English man John Dawson.Elisha and his friends wait all night for dawn, the book takes place with them in one room, thinking about what they have to do, they have little conversation between each other.      I did not find the book Dawn very interesting,I found it to move very slow, because Elisha and his friends stayed in one room during the whole story, and while one man was thinking about what he should do or how he felt, the reader did not know how the other people where feeling at that time.  The part I found the most interesting was when there would be conversation between Elisha and his friends, especially when they talked about their pasts, which was one of my favorite parts of the book, it wasinteresting because there was more action happening when they when explaining their past.        Although I found this book boring for the most part it was very descriptive and therefore I would recommend it to anyone who likes very descriptive books.
books||2.0||I read the back cover of this book and immediately knew most of what would happen.  As soon as I met the character who would turn out to be the driver, I knew the rest of the story.  It was extremely easy to figure out and quite disappointing.  The story's decent.  The text flows nicely, and the suspension of disbelief is strong, but where did Nick's originality go?  Where's the sweet and innocent charm of The Notebook, A Walk to Remember, and Nights in Rodanthe?  It seems like he's run out of steam, or didn't care too much about this one.A decent book to read, but don't expect anything spectacular as you would with his earlier work
books||5.0|| I have enjoyed all of David Gemmell's work but this one takes the prize. It contains sorrow, great sacrifice, courage, honor, and some of the best battles every written. It is easy to see the scenes and the people as you read, the characters are ones you will become attached to. If you love fantasy that involves warfare and courage with people making the best of a bad situation and with no magic items to save the day, you will love this book
books||5.0||Lost in the Funhouse can be a very bewildering and irritating collection if you aren't in the right mood for it.  If you aren't well-versed in post-modern fiction (barthelme, calvino, etc are good reference points) you might want to start somewhere else first.  Even Barth's novels are more immediately digestible.With that said, though, this collection doesn't really operate on one consistent level.  Perhaps this is because many of these stories were written by Barth much earlier in his career.  The three stories concerning Ambrose's birth and development are very straightforward and enjoyable on a surface level until the whole series goes flying into left-field with the titular "Lost in the Funhouse" story (which Barth is probably most known for).  From that point on, most of the stories are more about the process of writing and the relationship between the reader, writer, and the characters.  Stories like "Title" and "Life-Story" work more as essays on the nature of fiction than actual works of fiction, and were (for me at least) a little tedious.  The best moments occur when Barth combines his thoughful analysis on the nature of writing and art with a really good ground-situation, typically based on Greek mythology.  The best of these are the utterly raunchy "Petitition" and the labyrinthine "Menelaiad".Taken as a whole, though, Lost in the Funhouse is greatly satisfying, even if (like me) you really only understood about 20% of what Barth was talking about on your first read-through.  It's the sort of book I'll go back to again and again to try and delve deeper into the mystery of the funhouse while appreciating all over the hilarious bawdy humor.Oh, and make sure to read Barth's seven additional notes at the front of the book (though maybe only after you've read the story that is being discussed in each note, so as not to ruin the initial experience)-- they really help to clarify some of Barth's intentions.  I can't even imagine appreciating a story like "Glossolalia" without having read the note concerning it
books||1.0||Let me start by saying that I would have given this book zero stars if I could.  The reviews I've read are all true.  This book is boring, extremely repetitive and a waste of time.  The only reason I finished it was because I paid for it.I truly believe that Danielle Steel has lost her gift of writing.  She has not published a good book in a long time.  I also think that she's lost her editor, because to me, a good editor wouldn't let books like this be printed.This story pretty much follows stories she's done before except it's told from the guy's point of view.  There's the rich guy, Charlie, who can't seem to find the "perfect" girl to marry.  He finds a flaw with every one he dates.  He lost his parents at a young age, his sister left school to raise him, and just before he graduated college, she died of a brain tumor.  So of course he's afraid that anyone he gets close to will die or leave him.Then there's rich Adam, whose wife left him and took their two children with her.  It was a bitter divorce, so he has no desire to ever marry again.  He dates girls half his age and never stays with one long.  His parents blame him for the divorce.  Every time he visits them, his mother let's him know what a huge disappointment he is to the family.The last of the trio is Gary, a struggling artist.  He has no desire to ever marry or date.The three men spend the month of August each year on Charlie's yacht, partying and going on and on about how they don't want commitments.  Well of course, each one meets someone, they start to date, they argue, they break up, they have their epiphany and everyone lives happily ever after.  Same old story.Danielle Steel should stop writing.  You can't tell me she doesn't have enough money to live on.  I for one will not read any more of her books, even a paperback, and I won't even bother renting them from the library.  I won't waste my time having to check the book out and worrying about getting it back on time.  There are better authors available and I'm going to read them
books||5.0||Since reading this book in 1994, I have used it as a reference for my life AND work. Using a warm and witty style of writing, Allen teaches us the physiological and emotional benefits of mirth.  My favorite chapter title is "Strike While the Irony is Hot!"  So clever!! I recommend this book to friends who are facing life challenges and to everyone who attends my workshops.  On a more personal note, since embracing The Healing Power of Humor, I felt freer to add a little levity to my Aunt Alice's funeral.  My family was amazingly grateful.    Me too

books||5.0||For most of us, the area of thanatology is something quite new, despite the fact that death is such an intimate "companion" that can come at any moment of our lives, whether by degrees or instantaneously, irrelevant of our ethnic, social and economic backgrounds. It is a plain truth that can not be avoided, and no technological advancements can make it go away. I would personally like to consider death as the ultimate best friend who would never desert you, despite what your feelings may be. And as a child has the innocent ablity to humanize a doll or a toy soldier, the adult must equally do so with death, not shy away from it and be totally uncommunicative to what it means: the total cessation of physical life, for if one denys its existence and its inevitability, the person could not only suffer from added unnecessary physical heartache, but he or she could also augment the physical stress with mental, spiritual and religious grief as well. Submission to and acceptance of the truth, no matter how difficult it would be to hear, could be the highest catharsis that medicine could not come close to healing. In Elizabeth Kubler-Ross's classic study of the dying process, she interviews patients of various age brackets who teach the living what dying means to them. But even though the experience is individualistic to that specific person, the process of dying has a universality to it which connects us all. Hence, how do you take the sting from the wound? In On Death and Dying, you remove the sting by communication and by simply being there to let the patient say what he or she has to say, to let them vent, and at their own pace, go through the classic defined stages of the dying process: denial and isolation, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. The patients become our teachers. We learn of their fears, their possible financial burdens, in one woman's case, the fear of the worms, et cetera. But we also learn about what the families go through, their own anger and disbelief and guilt. It is about pacing and the opening up of repressed fear for all the people involved. Sometimes there is cohesion in the shock and anger, other times not. The United States is one of the most death-denying countries out there, a fact most evident with plastic surgery on the rise and chiseled bodies to reverse the aging process, for going foward means only one thing: death. Ross's overall message is that death does not have to be and is not the horror that we all think it is, the grim reaper with the skeletal hand and the sharpened scythe. Death has issues for everybody, doctors, faith-filled people, even Ross heself. It is a step that we are all going to take sooner or later. But it is comforting to know that we are all in it together.   
books||4.0||I love historical fiction, and The March was one of the better historical novels that I've read. The characters are well-drawn, and the action moves along briskly, with no dead spots.  The civil war background seemed very authentic, and unlike many similar historical novels that focus on the military actions or the civilian actions, The March blends the two to show that war really is hell.Doctorow is an excellent writer, and he obviously did a lot of period research to make the background so believable.  My only objection was his implication that the civil war was only about slavery and that Union soldiers fought solely because of the slavery issue.  That's not true, as studies of Union soldiers' letters and diaries have demonstrated that most soldiers fought out of patriotism or to join with other family members, or for other reasons than just slavery.  That also applies to Confederate soldiers.  A minor quibble that doesn't really hurt the book, but it does discredit the author for not sticking to real, documented historical fact.Highly recommended

[Quran-60:8-9] GOD does not enjoin you from befriending those who do not fight you because of religion, and do not evict you from your homes. You may befriend them and be equitable towards them. GOD loves the equitable. GOD enjoins you only from befriending those who fight you because of religion, evict you from your homes, and band together with others to banish you. You shall not befriend them. Those who befriend them are the transgressors.
books||5.0||I am admittedly a terrible cook, so I follow recipes to the letter, often with nonmagical results. With Julia Child in my kitchen, however, things are looking up! Her recipe for roast chicken was so exact that even I could not mess it up. That and the sauteed beef steaks are now my go-to dinners because they are easy and reliable.  I've also had great success with the quiche and biscuit recipes and look forward to trying breadmaking for the first time.  This book is essential for anyone out on his or her own for the first time, newlyweds, or people like me who just don't get it (but really want to)
books||2.0||Before purchasing Made in Detroit I read the reader reviews.  The reviews were so mixed that I decided against buying the book and checked it out of the library instead.  As it turns out I made the best decision.  All I can say is `thank you fellow reviewers'; this book was definitely not worth the purchase price.  My statement has nothing to do with the author's writing skills, he is a skilled writer.  It has everything to do with his lack of insight.  That Paul Clemens could live in a city and have such a skewed view of it is downright scary.  I read the book, waiting for Paul to have a revelation that would help him put the pieces of his life together and make peace with them.  But after 241 pages he was no more enlightened than he was on page one.  Blacks are caricatures whose sole role in life is to make Paul's life hard.  Women are peripheral characters who are barely given a voice.  He finds a way to put down and demean everyone who is not a white male in his book.  If you are a white male who harbors secret racist feelings you will enjoy this book and it will validate your feelings.  If you are anyone else your reaction will no doubt range from mild boredom to outrage.  As I read this book I felt sadness, a profound sense of dismay and had some of my worse fears confirmed.  (There are white folks who actually still think like this.)  My hope is that the light comes on for Paul, he is still young.  If it does maybe he will share his insights with us.  
books||4.0||I am a longtime Jance fan and wasn't disappointed with Dead Wrong.  Any complaints would be the overemphasis on Joanna's pregnancy with a concomitant under-emphasis on tension and suspense (great ending, though!).  Butch is effectively out of the way in this installment as he promotes his book, but  also comes across as overly self-absorbed, especially when his obnoxious parents show up and his wife is poised to deliver their child.  Jenny, too has little to add to the story.  But Joanna shines, as usual. Nice to see such a reliable, ethical, and strong female protagonist

The book is perfect forstudent projects in science and the arts. It well worth theprice charged
books||1.0||Unfortunately, instead of an thorough analysis of the genesis, justifications, and problems with overarching property rights, DeLong acts as a mouthpiece for other property rights activists.  DeLong covers some of the same ground as Congressman Richard Pombo in his 1996 This Land Is Our Land, simply emphasizing anomalous examples instead of practicable solutions.  DeLong's denial of the externalities resulting from uninhibited development leave his analysis unbalanced and ill-founded.  DeLong's politics overcome his analysis.  This book is similar to his condemnation of industry for their recognition to the denial of carbon dioxide emissions.  (...)  His political agenda overwhelm his rational
books||5.0||Having worked with VBScript for a little over four years I am by no means an expert; however, I feel that my experience does give me somewhat of an advanced applied knowledge of scripting. I was pretty skeptical when I saw the word "Advanced" in the title, but this book laid all my concerns to rest in the early chapters.The book begins with securing (including digital certs and policies) and encoding scripts as well as listing some nice techniques for implementing alternate credentials in WMI and ADSI. For me personally, the real meat and potatoes of the book was the copious information pertaining to working with WSF and WSC files. Don and Jeffrey take the time to detail the reasons behind XML functionality as well as it's application within the scripted files. These guys clear up a lot of questions on these two subjects and how to package your scripts using these technologies. They wrap up the package peice with explanations around HTA's and form controls in HTML scripts.The book moves on to cover topics such as ADSI and ADO scripting, working with WshController and remote scripts, WMI and WQL classes and techniques, and different applicable real world examples. All this information is then wrapped up with tidbits of using scripting editors to debug, sign, and package your scripts as well the wizards (WMI, ADSI, WSF, etc) and other tools available to make scripting easier.I've obtained quite a few VBScript books over the years and this one is by far the only one dedicated to truly advanced VBScripting. If you are new to scripting with VBScript, you might want to start with another book geared to learning the methods, properties, classes, etc of the syntax and the technologies it can use. While this book does offer great explanations on advanced topics, you really need to have a solid background in scripting before you read it.Thumbs up! Highly recommended bang for the buck
books||4.0||A team of highly respected scientists is recruited and sent on the most exciting mission of their careers - they are to explore and catalog an expansive system of tunnels and caves deep below the Earth's surface in Antarctica.  They set off on their adventure only to learn that a team, like themselves, was sent on this same mission only 3 months prior and has never been heard from again.  They also learn that what makes this set of caverns so exciting and sought after is that they contain diamonds larger and more plentiful than any mankind has ever seen.  Wealth of this sort has attracted both dedicated scientists and individuals with more menacing plans in mind.  But these dangers are nothing compared to the beasts that are native to this subterranean world who are numerous and life threatening to the mission and the team.James Rollins' debut novel sets the stage for what has become his successful career writing scientific thrillers.  He does a wonderful job of incorporating biology, archeology, geology, and other various earth sciences into an exciting and page turning novel.  Some of his subsequent novels are stronger than this first work, but Subterranean does not disappoint and definitively sets the stage for his many books to come. 
books||5.0||The nature of a people is seldom easy to describe because the attempt is often sabotaged by either the Outsider's incorrect perceptions or the Insider's preconceptions, depending on which is constructing the definition. What we find with W.J. Cash's The Mind of the South is no different, although it is a pleasant journey. Sparkling with some of the most fluid prose ever found in historical writing, Cash's work deserves recognition for this reason alone; yet there is value in the exposition itself, even if it forgets a full two-thirds of the South's population in its description (blacks and women). What the modern reader is left with, then, is not so much a description of the "the southern mind" as it is "the white southern male mind." And while Cash's work does not quite apologize for the many neuroses of that mind, it does attempt to explain the effects it has had on our perception of the American South, with a small dash of glory added for good measure. First, it is important for us to take into account the wonderful introduction to the work by Bertram Wyatt-Brown. Wyatt-Brown shows that Cash's battle with depression was a salient part in understanding his interpretation of the South, as was his upbringing. Wyatt-Brown seems to agree with my assessment on the Insider/Outsider effect:    "The origins of Cash's interpretation of his culture and region lay not only in the objective fact of Southern intransigence about issues of race and change, but in the very makeup of his mind. Like so many creative depressives, he stood apart from the society around him. Such a position of detachment can provide a special angle of vision that those immersed in society cannot obtain (Cash xxvii)." Wyatt-Brown, with this statement, makes Cash an outside-Insider, by virtue of his being a manic depressive. He is a southerner, and therefore capable of the same preconceptions of his own people as any southerner; however, according to Wyatt-Brown, by reason of his mental condition, he is elevated away from this status and into a new status altogether, a presumably better one. I would agree with this, if the work itself is to be taken as proof. Cash is capable of wonderful insights into his own culture and society. However - and this is crucial! - we must not gloss over the fact that by omitting women and blacks from his work, Cash loses some credibility. It is here, it seems, that Cash could not escape the Insider mentality. This work is characterized by one over-arching theme: southern culture, though as elusive in most respects as any other, is penetrated throughout with one defining and collective temperament. In essence, this work is interpretative rather than linear, as it attempts to analyze rather than delineate. This elevates Cash from the traditional historian (in the mold of Clement Eaton) to sociologist or social commentator (in the mold of David Halberstam). That is not to say that Cash does not know his history or pilfers it from others; it seems impossible after reading The Mind of the South for one to imagine Cash using such smooth language while pulling facts from anywhere outside his own mind. The disjointed quality usually apparent in any attempt to fuse sources without an overall voice is thankfully absent. Cash is who we hear while we read, and it is his elucidative brush-strokes that paint the image of the Southerner.Much is left out of this short review of Cash's work, as brevity is a consideration. A more complex examination of the work would require many more words than I have time for at the moment. But I do feel obligated to at least sum up the trajectory of Cash's masterpiece. The first few chapters lay the groundwork for Cash's southern temperament - individualistic, violent, quasi-aristocratic, provincial, just to name a few - while the remainder of the work displays the evolution of that temperament while it is worked upon by forces both outside it and from within, and its own natural need to adapt. The Yankee plays his part, as does Uncle Tom and the fugitive slave, the southern belle and the Garrison abolitionist, the carpet-bagger and the scalawag, the confederate soldier and the lynch mob, the fire-eater and the bible-thumping revivalist. It is impossible for any society to exist in a vacuum, or as a prehistoric insect preserved in amber. That being said, it is still remarkable that the American south came as close as it did
books||2.0||The trouble starts early. There is an apologetic preamble which states that the author(s) would not dedicate precious space to titles that are well known and well documented beyond the gaming community. This is an enormous assumption about the general public's knowledge - both of video games and more-so it's history of design. Many people that have heard of these games or seen their children watch the TV-spinoffs, most likely would not be able to identify what the games actually look(ed) like or anything about their play dynamics in a gaming environment.Even though Mario, Zelda, Pokemon, Donkey Kong, Defender, Asteroids, Missile Command, Frogger, etc. are mentioned briefly there are no images of reference for these classic games for us to (a) review and recognize, and (b) learn from. If this is supposed to be a sort of retrospective of the graphic art of game design (this is not about studies of techniques for rendering) then why not show some of these all-time classics as well as the 'new-time' classics? The latter are better represented throughout the book but some of the choices are omissions are questionable. The brief smattering of 'classics' that are shown tend to be more human-looking figurative than 'iconic' which seems lacking to me in breadth and style of representation.Beyond this much of the work - but not all - feels and looks rather 'same-y' to me. Lots of brooding dark scene-scapes and characters clearly inspired by countless horror/goth/fantasy masters such as Boris Vallejo or much of the work seen in Heavy Metal. When there is mention of games that are actually considered modern art on display at world-famous museums, such as "Rez," -- we are not shown any images of it because space was taken up by two nearly identical renderings of Lara Croft(!) in the same spread. One has to ask oneself: what was the author/picture editor thinking?The fact of the matter is that for all the long-winded talk in the intro there is little to graphically show us where the industry came from verses where we are now. And from what I can tell, there is absolutely no mention of the explosion of games and utterly unique designs being done in FLASH. Arguably one of the largest and least expensive/complicated environments for making a unique game. Furthermore, all the games covered and talked about (that I can tell) are from very large corporations and as such tend to be slanted and biased in a number of regards.My biggest problem with this book was the editing - particularly with regard to choices of art. Far too many examples if things that look the same versus examples of unique design concepts and forms as well as proper representations for an historical analysis. Very nice printing, some nice layouts, and some interesting topics are raised with relation to character conception versus form, versus environment - but I would not recommend this for critical graphic design analysis or critical anything
books||4.0||Simon Winchester is a popular historian, in the modern mold. This means that he's socially and politically a liberal, and that he's interested in *everything* connected with a specific event. He'll examine it from all angles, and attempt to see it from everyone's eyes, look over everything connected with it, and then draw some conclusions. Usually, those conclusions over-reach some (I'm being general about this type of writer, not of Winchester specifically) and the point of view is relentlessly modern.Winchester has chosen as the topic of this book the explosion of the volcano Krakatoa in 1883. Interestingly, the author is trained as a geologist, though he has spent most of his life working as a journalist and writer. This means that he actually understands the terminology of geology and vulcanology enough that he can at least make an attempt to explain it to the rest of us in layman's terms, and the result is generally a happy one. Krakatoa was a complex event (the island had three summits, each a separate volcano: two disappeared in the explosion, but they erupted for a good while beforehand, and their effects lasted for years afterwards) and Winchester does a good job of relating what happened, the prelude to it, and the aftermath.The one criticism that people have which I agree with is that he tends to wander a bit, at times. There are discussions here of everything from Dutch Colonial policy to the habits of spiders to rather technical (though carefully explained) geology. While it's all interesting, sometimes it does stray a bit far from the chosen topic. The author also occasionally over-reaches, a bit. For instance, his assertion that the explosion of the volcano indirectly led to Indonesia's independance is a bit much. My edition included a magazine article he'd written just after the Boxing Day tsunami, in which he attempts to connect the San Francisco earthquake with George W. Bush's election as U.S. President...that seems and even bigger stretch, to be honest.When the author sticks to the story, however, what he writes is very interesting. I would recommend this book
books||1.0||Steer clear of this one - criticizing others for lack of original thought or a consistent viewpoint, while virtually copying their cover (not to mention riding the wave of their unique concept) illustrates the weak and timid position assumed  by this author.  Please achieve your own significance, not bashing others popular and widely accepted readership.  As Christians, we are obviously aware of varying theories on end-times.  To even slightly indicate we are not aware indicates the authors pompous platform.  So sad his approach couldn't be based on his own original work
books||1.0||Although Dead Soul begins quite decently and surprisingly for Doss, who has a tin ear for dialogue, dearly loves a cardboard character, and has no sense of plot, it rapidly and unsurprisingly disintegrates into a mangle of missed opportunities. Since most plot reveals take place off scene, you have no idea what's going on until the end where Charlie tells all. Is this supposed to create suspense? Does Doss even realize how ridiculous this is? Does he have an editor? Can the editor read English? Now these are real questions for Charlie to answer
books||2.0||Time was when the words Betty Crocker actually stood for something good in cookbooks, although the books' recipes, for better or for worse, were always a product of their times.  The very first "Betty Crocker Picture Cook Book" was published in 1950 (still available), revolutionized how cookbooks were produced, and was an enormous best-seller.  The recipes were the result of much thorough testing in the company's kitchens and in homes across America.  This was cooking from scratch with very little reliance on convenience foods in its pages.  This gradually changed as Betty and her books became more and more of a shill for General Mills' products and her name got plastered on one mix after another to the benefit of the company's bottom line, but to the detriment of good cooking.  The two all-purpose cookbooks that came out in 1961 and 1969 were both loaded with recipes and wonderful tips/helps, although you could see the beginnings of sacrificing quality for convenience--especially in the 1969 edition--but this was still relatively minor in proportion to the majority of the recipes.  If you have one of these books, treasure and keep it; you'll never see their likes again.The current 10th edition looks good but, like the past several editions, the number of recipes has been drastically reduced.  Gone are the many variations, which are especially missed in baked goods.  It was wonderful having recipes of many cakes that were sized for two people or small families and having different mixing methods to choose from.  Now way too many recipes are of the "dump and stir" method instead of choosing methods that would insure the best results.  Also gone is the very friendly, assuring, conversationial voice of yesteryear.  Yes, there are recipes covering a wider range of ingredients and styles, but they are mostly stripped-down versions.  It's obvious that the folks at Betty Crocker now seem to think that no one really cooks anymore and can't be bothered with proper preparation of dishes, which begs the question of why General Mills even bothers to publish these cookbooks anymore.  The "Better Homes and Gardens New Cookbook" is a better bet for those looking for an all-purpose, everyday guide.  It has a better layout, the recipes and ingredients are generally of a higher quality, and there are more recipes and variations than Betty Crocker's had in some time.  Even better, if you care at all about the quality of the food you eat and serve your family, I highly recommend the cookbooks of Cooks' Illustrated/America's Test Kitchen.  Their comparable, general-purpose cookbook is called "The America's Test Kitchen Family Cookbook."  The recipes are tested and reworked--dozens of times, if necessary--to be the best their staff can make them and you get precise directions in preparing them.  It's a shame that Betty Crocker has abdicated her throne and good name, but there's even better stuff out there now.  Go for it!
books||5.0||The use of an Integrated Development Environment [IDE] for a user to learn a language in, and to then program within, is well known. Microsoft has made powerful IDEs for its languages. And the open source Eclipse can be used for Java. Along these lines, Ducasse offers his book. It teaches Smalltalk using the Squeak IDE. The twist is that Squeak uses the visual metaphors of robots and robot factory, to convey the crucial concepts of objects/classes. As Ducasse explains, Squeak can be directed at an audience that is perhaps of high school age or even younger. So a clear visual feedback between example code and what the student sees then happen is vital, given her limited background and possibly limited attention span. Squeak uses Smalltalk in part because that is a very minimalist language. If you come from C++, Java or C#, you may be struck by its simplicity, compared to the oodles of classes and notational intricacies of those languages. Which of course also makes it easier for a young student to learn Smalltalk or Squeak itself.I wonder a little about the book itself, though. A motivated high school student could easily use it. But for some younger students? In that situation, it may well be that the book could be best directed at a teacher, who can then instruct from it
books||4.0||Have read the whole Leaphorn/Chee series by Tony Hillerman. This is one of the better ones - the subject is topical and the characters take on more definition. The overall "feel" is that this time, the subject is of a more personal nature to Tony Hillerman? A good read
books||1.0||i was more than willing to give None Dare Call It Treason a chance, as i found the scale of Stormer's research impressive. However, the fact that none of his predictions concerning a massive Communist takeover in America came to pass, coupled with his outspoken admiration for McCarthy and truly insane predictions like this:"Once the takeover comes, you, like millions of others, who believe in God and man's responsibility for his own actions, can be slaughtered like diseased animals or worked to death in slave labor camps or brothels for the Red Army." p. 20have forced me to conclude that Stormer's thesis was overwhelmingly incorrect. Perhaps the most irritating part of the book was his suggestion that the American educative system was hopelessly pro-Communist. The fact that None Dare Call It Treason was distributed in American high school classes rather undermines his argument.the sad thing is, because None Dare Call It Treason is so exhaustively researched, it is far too dry to be amusing, even when read ironically. and ironic amusement is the only positive product of propaganda.in closing, i would take Communism over John A. Stormer's America any day
books||4.0||'A Little History of the World' is exactly what the title indicates. Gombrich takes the reader from the dawn of time to the mid-twentieth century. Gombrich covers cave men, great religious leaders, philosophers, and events over an incredible timeline.I got this book for my eight year old son and I to read together. There were certain chapters and topics which grapped his attention. Other chapters were a little over his head in regards to understanding the causes for certain events. In particular, the chapters covering the Inquisition and the causes that lead to the French Revolution were a little difficult for him to truely understand.This book is a great way to introduce a child to the wonderful stories that make up the world we live in. It may also be a stepping stone to further reading on subjects that spark some interest
books||4.0||On the way to a conference in New Orleans, my flight from Raleigh to Charlotte was cancelled due to mechanical problems, and I was booked on a flight to D.C. As I boarded the plane with "The Carolina Way" under my arm, a gentleman seated at the front of the plane asked how I was enjoying the book.  I explained that I had not yet started the book, so I could not give an answer.  The gentleman followed me to my seat and introduced himself as Dr. Gerald Bell, the co-author of "The Carolina Way".  Myself a Carolina fan, I was pleased to meet Dr. Bell, as he spent several minutes talking about Coach Smith, whom I have admired for over forty years, and the UNC basketball program, which is presently undergoing a much needed resurgence under Coach Roy Williams. Dr. Bell's contributions to the book tie Coach Smith's leadership philosophy to practical business applications by relating wonderful anecdotal references from Carolina's storied history to today's business situations.  Surely, Coach Smith, given his ability to recruit top players, has been criticized by many for his failure to win NCAA championships in the manner of Coach John Wooden at UCLA, but winning two NCAA championships, winning at a consistency high level unmatched by any program without violating strict NCAA rules, and coaching top players that graduated at a +90% rate and have gone on to be successes in their chosen professions underscore the unique successes of Coach Smith's "system".  Teamwork, integrity, loyalty, and hard work, are the cornerstones of the Carolina Way, and anyone in the position of managing, leading, or molding young people today would benefit from reading this book, corny as it is at times.  This book is not just for Carolina basketball fans
books||2.0||No wonder John Gardner didn't write more fiction books.  He was far too preoccupied with what he believes makes good fiction, rather than actually writing it.  "Creative atrophy" I believe John Gardner himself would call it.  If there's ever been a better example of the "those who can't do, teach" argument, I haven't encountered it.  This is hardly the place a "Young Writer" should start.  Instead, how about reading what you like and avoiding "ignoramouses" such as John Gardner?  John Gardner is unable to accept the fact that many of the world's finest writers never made it through college, and many more didn't have the luxury of a "rigorous classical education."   The most hilarious part is where Gardner mentions that only through a line-by-line university level discussion will anybody ever be able to fully enjoy Shakespeare.  It's interesting to note how Gardner, who "taught" creative writing at the university level, fails to exhibit the critical thinking and objectivity he says one can only obtain through a college education
books||1.0||When I picked up True Believer, I was anticipating a good mystery as well as the chance to empathize with sensitively drawn characters.  Neither panned out.  This book is boring.  The characters are one-dimensional and there is no mystery.  Too much detail and not enough substance.  Not sure what the point of the story was as I didn't get it
books||1.0||I bought this off of the New York Public Library website.  What an utter waste of $40.  The book that comes with the software is somewhat helpful, but honestly there is no new information to anyone who has been collecting books for a while.  The worst part is the "software" that you are supposed to use to catalog your books.  First of all, it is difficult to install--this is always a sign of a inferior product: no product that was properly QA'd would be released in such condition.  Second of all, the product is just a fancy version of a spreadsheet.  I could literally use Excel or MS Access to catalog my books just as well as this software.  You actually have to input EVERY piece of data associated with a book.  There is no excuse for anyone with an Internet connection to have to manually input book data.  I state again: it is very surprising that the New York Public Library would include this product in their stores.  It is a major, major rip off and there are far superior cataloging products out there.The product I finaly ended up using is one called Readerware (http://www.readerware.com/).  Readerware, for the same amount of money ($40), allows you to scan in the barcodes of your books--the software comes with its own CueCat scanner.  Then the software looks up the barcodes you entered, (using the Internet),  and updates each barcode with all the available info on the book. I scanned 800+ books in about 4-5 hours.  BTW, you can also use Readerware to scan in all of your DVDs and CDs, (you have to pay more to get the full version of Readware that supports books, DVDs, and CDs).Of course, you don't have to take my recommendation to buy "Readerware", but please don't waste your money on "Your Home Library.
books||1.0||This book proves once again, that you don't necessarily have to be a good writer to make lots of cash and sell huge quantities of books to the mass market.  "True Believer" is an all-star team of cheap, shallow cliches.  There is no plot.  No one really believes anything, and everything is a contrived, superficial mish-mash.  The dialoge has no depth, and when you've had too much dialoge, there's paragraph after paragraph of the main characters, "thinking" to themselves.  Wow, is this bad.  "Message in a Bottle" was a great plot idea, but its been a slow, steady descent since then.  You might have a good laugh at it like I did, but otherwise I was very disappointed.
books||2.0||The book is divided into 52 chapters that repeat basically the same points over and over again. So you have to read through the chapters and try to spot the occasional new idea. It seems strange that a book on productivity makes you waste time gleaning a few good ideas. (Come on, man, if you have 10 pages of good ideas, give them to me in 10.) But then again I guess most books in this genre make you do that. Sheesh
books||4.0||After reading a book of Sandra Brown's that I horribly disliked, I was hesitant to give her another shot. I'm truly glad I did; The Witness was a first-rate thriller!The villains in this book are greasy, sick individuals that rather turned my stomach...just what you like when you want to get a taste of Why A Person Would Run For Their Life! Sandra Brown wrote these characters (and that of Ricki Sue-who I could easily picture!) particularly well. The baby was truly the icing on the cake: this infant motivated Kendall throughout the book and, like any mother, lived for the love of her child.I also loved the sexy, romantic element here-it was just enough that it didn't overwhelm the story...even better, it didn't change Kendall into a mindless goober (a state which many female characters in "romance" novels often achieve.)The Witness succeeded on so many levels yet fell short of a full five-star rating. Perhaps it was the Crooks...they came off a bit cliche, but were still necessary characters.Still, this book is an excellent, thought-provoking choice with a WOW ending. Very enjoyable
books||4.0||It may sound as though I am damning this book with faint praise, but I believe that with a subject as complicated as anti-western feeling there are few better places to begin than with a good conversation opener.Written in clear non-academic language, Buruma and Margalit have written a book-length essay which further elaborates on the article which they published several years ago in the New York Review of Books. The point of the project is to posit a hypothesis on the roots of anti-western feeling and use that to draw open the discussion as to how the gap can be repaired.I notice that the original article sparked much less disappointment than the book. There is something about the translation to book form which implies a level of completion or comprehensiveness that an essay by itself cannot achieve. You will find that most reviewers (myself included) had a list of things that we missed in their overview. These omissions felt serious to me, but I notice that the lists have very little in common. It is truly not possible to please everyone or include everything, so perhaps it is just as well that they did not try.If you already have an adament point of view in this discussion, then this book may well irritate you. Buruma and Margalit clearly do their best to be as objective as possible, given their own cultural bias. If, however, you are like me and mostly have a clear view about your own lack of answers then you will probably find this a valuable reading experience. Since reading it, I lent the book to a good friend (sorry, publishers!) and we have not been able to stop discussing the points that it raised. Quite an accomplishment, in my opinion, for a self-described short history.
books||1.0||This book shows how Robert has been lying all along. He talks about how he bought his dream car while being homeless. Ok then, how did Robert make the monthly payment? Why would he be stupid enough to sleep in a Porsch as a bum? This guy is such a liar and is trying to con the masses. He is a conman and a good one. Thats why hes a motivational speaker. It takes a good speaker to con you out of your hard earned money. Don't fall for this conman! This book contradicts what Robert has been preaching in previous books. Robert says pay off your debt while he says he bought his dream car while being homeless. That would be odd but it isn't odd because Robert is a professional liar
books||2.0||If your into Hendrix enough to want to find out more about Electric Ladyland, your probably already going to know everything in this book. If you've read such great Hendrix books such as 'Electric Gypsy' then you won't get much from this book other than information obtained that you've read before from 'Electric Gypsy' coloured in this authors opinion on Jimi's music.The author lays down his opinion that reads like someone either not overly impressed by Jimi Hendrix, or someone that has trouble laying praise where it's due. The author makes big calls in this book which fall flat, for example expressing his view on how Jimi could of edited and recorded certain songs better in his opinion (not unlike like Alan Douglas made true) or ego trips like footnotes after mentioning 'Like A Rolling Stone' at Monterey can only be outdone by the rare hard to find Flamingo Club version in 1968 - where does he get that from? The Flamingo club version is near inaudiable for most of the recording with its vocals and the guitar very distorted at the very least and is no way a superior rendition than Monterey but the book has many little comments by the author like that which only makes you think, is this guy trying to brag about his Hendrix collection? Or does he just have to have a different opinion on everything to try and make his book, which really has nothing new, stand out from the pack? His opinions would be valid if he didn't try to go against the grain to just go against the grain! If you've ever heard or seen Jimi at Monterey you don't need to be told how so many people thought he played crap that night - the evidence that this is one of his greatest performances is right there on CD or on the screen as you watch it which just makes bringing up that negative side without balancing it with the many rave reviews he also got seem targeted. Why point out the bad things and not mention the good?If you want to learn the technical side of the recording or the technical side of Hendrix, you won't learn it from this book. You'll get the classic Hendrix bio for most of it with this Authors strange comments, some bad reviews for Electric Ladyland to show Hendrix was human after all i guess and an author bringing up all his 'friends' and 'visits' to people that are well documented in knowing Jimi. All in all, if you have no opinion on Hendrix and read this you probably won't think he's that great and get a distorted opinion on him, if you love Hendrix and read this you'll wonder why this Author bothered to write a book about Jimi in the first place other than to let us know he has so many friends that knew Jimi, was lucky enough to see him play a few times and the funniest of all, could of done some things better in his opinion.Two stars because there's many books out there with much more information about Electric Ladyland, let alone Hendrix, that aren't trying to re-write Jimi's history from one person's perspective and critique thou it's cheap and quite funny if you have a big Hendrix library anyway.

Although many people I have recommended it to have reported that they have not been able to "get into it" - for me, I would say it is the best book I have ever read.  This is about the 5th copy I have purchased because when I lend it out, somehow it is not returned and I want to have a copy to re-read every now and then.  (I will not be lending this one again

I just couldn't get into the plot. I even found the story somewhat disturbing and eerie, especially for young children to read. There are very evil characters in this book who would be much better suited for an adult sci-fi novel, rather than a book marketed for children and young teens. The characters were unlikeable, and the plot just never seemed to grab my attention. I was very dissapointed that this is from the same author who wrote the amazing Bartimeus trilogy books! Well, I figured I would add my two cents in and let people know I just didn't like this book

books||4.0||I'm a fan of Bill Myers work and have been since "Blood of Heaven". This one slipped by me somehow and when I saw it I immediately got it. While the plot is somewhat tight for the most part, I do have some problems with parts of it. For one thing, the thought of a terrorist who will kill someone very close to him (read the book to find out) shouldn't have any qualms about killing millions of others. So why is he so intent on the stones? But the most annoying part of the book is the fact that people call each other by their names so much that it gets old. The minute anything happens, they're all screaming each other's names in the midst of the chaos until you finally just want them to shut up and get on with it. For the first-time emergency, we can live with it...but when something happens every few chapters, you've got to have a break! "Daniel!" "Tyler!" "Helen!" "Tyler!" "Daniel!" "Dad!" "Helen!" "Tyler!" Give me a break! Otherwise, a good story...though not up to the same level as "Threshold" or "Blood of Heaven" (definitely better than "Eli" though). Recommended

For those familiar with his theology, DON'T buy this book.  It will be a waste of your money.  For those who would like to know more about Calvin's theology, without getting caught in mid 16th century language or too deep into theology, buy this.

books||2.0||after get shorty, e.l. might just wish shamelessly that his next book with those same chili palmer characters might hit the goldmine and pay dirt and being bought up by the dumb hollywood producers and made into another movie again, with this single-minded purpose focused, e.l. wrote this totally unnecessary sequel to get shorty. and he was right again, it was bought and made into a movie again, but pathetically, a horrible one compared to get shorty. the novel itself was also a complete failure with so many obvious evidences that e.l. indeed wrote it in a way for another movie in mind. i simply failed to find there's any interest in reading this going nowhere story. it just like reading a double imaged e.l. personified in chili palmer and lobbying so hard to make this novel into a movie, with all the bore-to-death script, dialogue readymade for hollywood to grap. how could you imagine that those winnos in los angeles, especially those who in the hiphop music biz would watch 'charlie rose' and would have known and recognized chili palmer as the producer of 'get shorty'? you think those people would faithfully turned on their tv and channel surfed to pbs to watch 'charlie rose'? and at every corner of los angeles, every table in any restaurant, almost everyone would recognize 'chili palmer'? and you have to ask yourself: since when people would recognize a behind-the-screen movie producer, even a director in person? even they stand in front of you and claim themselves they are? yeah, maybe elmore leonard would watch 'charlie rose' regularly? and you think that charlie rose would interview a notorious shylock in his show? give me a break! this book, from the 1st page to the last was an absolutely no-brainer, so shallow and so superficious! just a total unnecessary and unwanted cash-in
books||1.0||A very disappointing book, and again, makes me very wary of any item on a "New York Times Best Seller List" or any other list, and really any big name reviewer recommendation.This book has one 50 page chapter which is excellent - the recap of the Thompson "Shot heard around the world" homerun. If you are a baseball fan as I am, that (barely) made the book worthwhile. The other 700 pages are disjoint, incomprehensible, and really trivial. You come away thinking "I really don't care bout this stuff" - I don't care about the dynamics of trash, about J Edgar Hoover's bathroom habits, Klara Sax's artistic depression and annoying infatuations about roof tops, about characters that just don't have much depth to really care about. At the end, even potentially interesting characters like Albert (the one on the baseball quest) become hard to bear. The whole book in fact had the feel of going to a senior citizen home.I read this book, as perhaps others did, expecting a book about the mafia or about other figures in the underworld. What I got was a book with a good first chapter, some interesting tidbits here and there about how life used to be in the 50's (fear of nuclear weapons, duck and cover classroom exercies), and a lot of knowledge about the trash business. The "masterful" epilogue, as other reviewers call it, really does no justice to a reader who has spent so much time toiling over Delillo's ragtag story telling. I am ok with stream of consciousness writing, or nonchronological chapters, or even random chapters, but the methods used in thsi book served no purpose other than to further make the reading difficult. Was this book about how mundane our lives are versus the bigger things that occur around us? Or how each of us is on an individual quest? Or that the 50's-60's-70's-80's were just years of fear, and the 90's are years of greed? I am still unsure, I still don't think any of these themes came across well.Please - not pretending to be a sophisticate, intellectual, or professional critic - but this book is really not worth the time or effort. You can be staisfied by a number of other books, including the "The Corrections" by Franzen or "The Cold Six Thousand" by Ellroy  which cover a similar period or similar themes and do not make you so frustrated or disappointed at the end.Read the first chapter, then put the book down or you will be sorely disappointed and have wasted an awful lot of time.

books||2.0||I was drawn to this book by the promise of experiencing or gaining familiarity with a new part of Paris, a city I have visited often.  The book fell far short of that.  It left me disappointed and longing for what I had missed.  It was difficult to connect with or enter into the story primarily  because the author failed to portray a personal intimacy with the subject. As an example, she tells us that moving within Paris was a bigger event than imagined but the description lacked emotional depth. Where were her feelings, little experiences, failings, successes, reactions. Overall, the author proved she has knowledge but does not know how to share it.

I think America could do better by picking a different first woman president. Someone with some morals and a love of our country. She has neither. It is an important "first" that should withstand the test of time. Historians are going to have a field day writing all the trash these two are involved in. Her mothering skills reveal a great deal about her character. Her child was always placed last. The only time Hillary showed any family unity was when it was necessary for the media to put her in a positive light.How did these two gain so much wealth in such a short amount of time?  They did not even own property when "they" became president.  There are still a lot of questions to be answered, and many more books to be written about this family. 8 years of these two is quite enough.

books||2.0||This book provides nothing new.  It is centered on the whole idea of setting up your retirement accounts so they automatically deduct from your paycheck.  If you have 401k, duh, it does that automatically...anyway, boring.  It also says to save money, don't use credit cards, pay yourself, blah, blah, blah.  Oh yeh, if you save early you will be a millionaire in like forty years...zzzz.   Ok, it did help me by reminding me about the interest rates in banks.  One idea was to put the emergency funds in a money market account which offers a higher interest rate than a regular savings account.  Upon reading this, I decided to do this and doing this made me realize the dismal .2% I've been earning on my saving account.  And not realizing the latest craze started by ING, all the other banks offer an "online savings" account which offers 5% compare to the dismal .2%.  I immediately switched!  Other than this part of the book, it was boring

books||5.0||Hugh Hewitt is right on target encouraging Republicans to remain loyal to President George W. Bush.  We are confronted with a long term fight against Islamic nihilists.  The Democrats who dominate that party nationally are essentially pacifists trapped in the mindset of the countercultural excesses of the 1960s.  Indeed, if the Democratic Party returns to power, the war on terror will be severely compromised---if not lost.  Even theological modernists like myself recognize that the Republican Party also best represents the values required to underpin a viable social order.  And yes, we need to purify our ranks and rid ourselves of back stabbers like Senator Lincoln Chafee.  But what about the Republican crybabies who threaten to severely damage the party if it fails to cater to their excessive demands?  These folks may be our greatest threat in the elections of 2006.  Many of them possess a suicidal Nietzschean streak.  In their heart of hearts, they idiotically believe we should let the Democrats win so that the Republican Party can be "purified."  The author has yet to sufficiently deal with this crisis.  Hopefully, he starts to do so real soon before it's too late.The crybaby Republicans are particularly dangerous concerning the explosive illegal immigration issue.  A number of them come across as nativists who despise Hispanics.  We cannot, however, forget that the children of numerous illegal aliens are often American Citizens.  They get to vote at the age of 18---and will most certainly seek revenge on the GOP for harassing their parents.  Let's get something straight: we are also not going to send an estimated 10-12 million people back to their original homeland.  But aren't these individuals breaking the law?  Human law is not about the striving for utopian perfection.  Yucky sausage making compromises are occasionally required.  I may have a few complaints about Hugh Hewitt's newest book.  Still, you need to purchase a copy.  His overall advice is indispensable if you truly love your family and wish to protect the United States from ruin. David ThomsonFlares into Darkness
books||5.0||As the authors state in the preface of the book, the main focus of the text is to show the reader how to write high quality contracts. This is not a text intended to convince readers of the veracity of design by contract, but if you are a developer with an academic knowledge of assertions, then this book with its extensive examples will likely convert you to a design by contract advocate.Most of the examples presented in the book are written in Eiffel, an object oriented language that fully supports preconditions, postconditions and invariants without need for preprocessing. If you haven't written code in Eiffel I highly recommend that you download EiffelStudio and deploy the examples in this book. Although there are tools that offer assertion facilities, none provide the ease of use as that seen in the Eiffel language. The text covers a preprocessor that imparts assertions to Java, but the extra steps and unique keywords required to incorporate and activate the assertions are likely to prevent wide scale use of the tool in a software development environment.Some aspects of object oriented languages such as design by contract and multiple inheritance are often taught through a language and an integrated developer's environment that minimally supports the functionality. As such developers form a poor opinion of the concept and not the tool. The keyword support of contracts in Eiffel makes the language a perfect learning tool which will impart a more than academic understanding of the value of assertions. The authors state ardently that developers have a choice between spending hours hunting down the causes of runtime errors or instead allocating time to write thorough contracts. As a sometimes Eiffel developer I can state that this assertion is accurate. Since contracts also assign responsibility for the runtime errors, they are invaluable for debugging. I recall an instance when I encountered a postcondition violation while using a linked list from the Eiffel library. As a client of the class, I didn't spend any time tracking down the source of the error other than to report it along with the condition that triggered the error to the supplier. In industry significant time is spent debugging code prior to delivery and maintaining code afterwards. Any concept or tool that aids in this function is indispensable to the project. Apparently many people understood this notion since for several years the proposal to broaden Java to include keyword support of programming by contract was purportedly the most frequent "non-bug" report requested by Java developers.The book is well organized providing a set of step by step instructions on how to write robust contracts applicable to a wide range of examples from simple data structures to more advanced cases such as the implementation of the Observer Pattern. I considered myself well versed in design by contract but the six principles and guidelines as well as the frame rules, introduced successively via examples, provided a more rigorous approach to developing contracts than I had employed in the past.In Chapter 2, the distinction between basic and derived queries is discussed and all six principles are introduced through a stack example. Each principle is unveiled in conjunction with designing methods and their contracts for the data structure.In the development of the dictionary class in Chapter 3, the authors present a case for a new query which asks if the dictionary already contains a specific key. The query arises from the specific application of the principles pertaining to postconditions. This is an excellent example of how contracts result in the development of new and needed features in a class. In Chapter 6, the authors present a clear rational for weakening inherited preconditions and strengthening postconditions and invariants in accordance with other literature pertaining to the same topic. In particular, the example of a delivery service reads like a case of retail agreement in plain language but is complemented by examples of code and UML diagrams. The concept of guarding postconditions with preconditions to facilitate possible redefinition of methods is also introduced and well explained.Chapter 8 covers the benefits of design by contract and if the reader has compiled and executed the examples presented in the book, they will have experienced some of these benefits firsthand. Of course there are considerations like better documentation and more reliable code, but the debugging assistance is the most overt benefit of contracts. The stack traces associated with assertion exceptions are an invaluable tool during both development and maintenance. Anyone who has developed quality software under a tight schedule understands the benefits of precision bug identification and resolution.Analysis by contract, introduced in the final chapter, presents the concepts of design by contract abstractly removed from the code specifics. The authors present an analysis of a person withdrawing money from a bank. In doing so they codify the sequence of events based on the contract stating that the design is "derived from the specification rather than being a design that is also being used as a specification." The obvious implication of this is that the final product will likely fulfill the specification implicitly.This is a book packed with knowledge that is essential for all developers regardless of the current support of design by contract in conventional languages. In the future, as the more popular languages incorporate additional design by contract concepts, there will be an increased number of authors producing texts on these topics as well as a growing number of developers annotating their resumes accordingly. I suspect that all of these texts will reference Design by Contract by Example and many of the developers that already understand the concept will be well acquainted with the pages of this book.

books||1.0||I found this book embarrassing to read - not because it's risque, but because it so clearly illustrates how the French & Italians got their reputations as great lovers. Is this the best that English literature can give us? This fellow clearly understands little of female anatomy, let alone female sexuality. It's also mean-spirited. Lawrence proves his points by setting up his version of idealized man and even more idealized woman, and then spends most of the book trying to knock down every other character and concept. This is his only real method of proving the superiority of his ideal. He drips way too much contempt.Everything outside of sex is dumb, meaningless, ridiculous. Attempting to derive enjoyment from the "mental life" makes one ridiculous; being paralyzed makes one ridiculous; trying to have sex in any way outside Lawrence's own true and correct way makes one pathetic, or defective, or spiteful; not being able to enjoy the sort of lovemaking Lawrence proposes makes one undeserving of the title of "woman" or "man"; and so on. Looking at Italian art is stupid. Everything in Paris is stupid. Constance can apparently tell from a glance that nobody in France knows how to have sex properly.Reading the book without his openly contemptuous commentary on what's "wrong" with everyone except C. and M., one might easily conclude that Constance doesn't really seem happier now that she's sleeping with the gamekeeper, and Hilda does seem happier in Venice - the author counters this by ridiculing "that kind" of happiness as delusional and druglike. He even seems to imply that her being so pleased with her life is yet more proof that there's something wrong with her. Of course Constance is wretched, because she does not have that one thing that, in Lawrence's view, really matters in life - not Mellors, but Mellors' equipment. This book does degenerate into phallus-worship, which makes the author's hostility toward "druglike" pleasures seem sort of ironically comical.Hilda is pathetic precisely because she can derive enjoyment from sensual pleasures: from Venice, from the feel of the sun, from jazz, from dancing. This seems weird to me - as if Lawrence is punishing the uppity woman. Hilda is also described as worse than pathetic - she is a "user", with strong suggestions that she is cold and immoral - because she enjoys that part of dancing which allows her to press up against a strange man, only to walk away when the dance is over. (This may be why at least one reviewer called the book sexist, since obviously Lawrence doesn't mind if Mellors is callous and behaves as a "user".) It's actually sort of creepy how an author who seems to be claiming that sensuality is good consistently knocks sensual pleasures like the feel of sunshine on one's body. Everything is stupid except sex - and not just any sex, but his notion of real sex. This is where astute readers will have the most trouble. Lawrence clearly defines a "real" woman - Constance Chatterly - by contrasting her with bad examples. A woman who lays there "unfeeling" is clearly an example. Such a woman is described in terms suggesting she lacks warmth/decency/heart/womanhood/etc. Lawrence doesn't even seem to have considered the possibility that maybe what the man is or isn't doing could even be related; it's presented quite clearly as a difference between good/desireable women vs. women who are defective not only physically, but in character.On the other hand, a woman with an unfeminine urge to be In Control - that is, one who insists on moving herself, rather than sitting passive and letting the man do what he will - is forgivable when Michaelis is the male (because he's premature, and meant to be pathetic), but it turns unforgiveable when it's women in general and especially Mellor's Bertha, who just refused to come when she should out of spite. Bertha just had a sick (!) urge to be In Control, demonstrating her essentially vicious and pathological nature. The only thing Mellors did wrong was to not put her in her place promptly - he "spoilt" her. As for all those touchy-feely things that women so frequently enjoy? Forget it. Lawrence suggests that Mellors does at least sometimes kiss and touch, but if it happens at all it appears to be mostly incidental, nothing important. A Real Woman doesn't need foreplay. Just hop on and go, and if she's what she ought to be, she'll feel crashing waves and dark tides sooner or later.These were what I found the most embarrassingly inaccurate - that a woman's duty is to lie there, not too passive, but not too active, and come when she's supposed to (and if she doesn't, it's her own fault); while a man's job is to climb on top and "perform". All of this is based on what ought to be a perfectly logical set of assumptions that are, unfortunately, not true. The truth is that a woman's vagina is not the equal-but-opposite inverse of a male penis; there's a thing that both males and females start out with, which in a man becomes the penis, and in the woman becomes (or remains) a clitoris. Lawrence seems to assume that what a woman feels is similar to what a man feels - but he assigns this feeling to the wrong body part. Women have always known about their own bodies; surely a man so dedicated to the advancement of sexuality could have and should have taken more time to research how women really feel about things, preferably apart from what women think men "want to hear". This, too, is no doubt why it has been accused of being "sexist". The author (or at least Mellors) openly blames women who cannot or will not "come to the crisis" when she ought, as if it were entirely of the woman's doing and had nothing at all to do with the man. It's also likely that science will eventually prove (if it hasn't already) that women like Constance Chatterly are not the norm or 'what a woman ought to be' emotionally as well as physically. For all that Lawrence spends an awful lot of energy ripping apart what he sees as silly, even noxious emotions and desires - such as "intimacy" and "connection", both of which he has Constance openly ridicule - biologists are increasingly finding that not only do men and women tend to have different feelings and expectations when it comes to the sex act, but that there is believed to be an evolutionary advantage in these differences, based on the notion that a man's biological job is to get his DNA out there, while reproduction for a woman involves a heavy emotional and physical commitment. If this is true, it would be the woman who takes such a cavalier and reckless attitude toward sex who is the deviant, not the one who wants to connect emotionally with the future sire of her child. So - while there may or may not be women who feel as Constance does, at the same time it's not so clearly obvious that a woman "should" feel that way, as to justify Lawrence's open belittling of women whose emotional states don't match masculine emotional detachment and distance.There's a lot of talk of "tenderness" - in fact, Constance keeps mentally accusing everyone in Venice of somehow "lacking tenderness" - but quite frankly I am unclear on what exactly is supposed to be so tender. The only thing he values about her is that he quite clearly likes having sex with her, but even there she only stands out particularly because a good sex partner is so difficult to find. I can imagine a woman putting up with - but I cannot imagine a woman particularly treasuring - a man who rebuffs her when she wishes to talk, who is rude to her instead of treating her as equal (remembering she's a Lady) when she asks him questions, who calls her c--t as if that were her name, and generally treats her as if she were a whore. I could imagine a woman finding this fun if it were a game they jumped into and out of, but this is how their relationship really is; she spends far too much time begging or wanting to beg him for reassurance - for the things he won't say and the questions he won't answer - for me to find her undiluted enjoyment in their relationship particularly credible.For what it's worth, I think life will be better when this book has become obsolete. It is exactly this sort of schlock that had women feeling pressured to fake their sexual responses - at great cost to their marriages, if not their selves. Those who agree that heppiness is linked to sexual satisfaction should be in favor of replacing this book with something that deals with sex in a way that reflects female sexuality in an honest and realistic fashion. As for those who just want a good read - I'd call it a matter of personal taste. Obviously some people enjoy this book. (Equally obviously, I did not.

books||5.0||The original publication of _The Lives of John Lennon_ in 1988 was accompanied by hysteria.  Much of it emanated from Yoko Ono, who likened Goldman's book to "being punched in the face."  Yoko is a close friend of Jann Wenner of Rolling Stone magazine, which duly ran an article attempting to discredit Goldman's book.  Some of Lennon's fans took this behavior in and assumed that _The Lives of John Lennon_ was forbidden; they would not read it because doing so would make them naughty.  Now, however, the dust has settled, and _The Lives of John Lennon_ holds up beautifully.  Each contention of Goldman's which was alleged to be outrageous in 1988 stands.  Remember the ridiculous panic over Goldman's portrait of Lennon as a heavy drug user?  That drug use has now been acknowledged by just about everyone who knew Lennon, including Ono and Lennon's first wife, Cynthia Powell.  The same is true about Goldman's claims about Lennon's tendency towards violence (a tendency Lennon himself owned up to in his Playboy interview).  And, while Ono and others acted agitated over Goldman's depiction of Lennon as bisexual, Ono herself is found to have said she considered John Lennon a "closet fag" in a 1981 interview.  (Why, then, was Ono so upset by the appearance of Goldman's book?  Because of what it reveals about her.)         It will be clear to anyone who approaches Goldman's book with a fair mind that the outrage its publication originally sparked was unjustified.  _The Lives of John Lennon_ is not dishonest or flawed in any way.  A perusal at his "Sources" section reveals his awesome thoroghness.  Goldman bravely explored areas of Lennon's and Ono's lives that others shied away from out of deference to Ono, a worshipful attitude towards Lennon, and a reluctance to figure things out.  Albert Goldman was the most fearless and thorough writer to approach this subject.  _The Lives of John Lennon_ might be overwhelming to the infantile fans who deify Lennon, but for those with genuine interest in Lennon, it is indispensable.

You may have also felt a spiritual presence while running, perhaps saying a prayer or working through personal problems while on the trail.  In this extraordinary book, Joslin explores this mind/body connection and gives many different ways to experience the spiritual side of the sport. He shares meditative techniques developed over many years and very rich personal experiences with excerpts from his running journal.  The book is well thought-out and written with a great deal of humility and care.  This is one that I will read again and again.  It changed the way I approach running.  I also think about this book throughout the day, even when I am not running.  A great book

books||4.0||Having read most of Grisham's books, I've saved a few of his "best" for last.  While it wasn't a 5 star book like I'd hoped, it certainly was one of his better books with a lot of detail and of course the plot was an interesting one.Having saw the movie years ago, I had a good idea of what the book was about:  Two Supreme Court Justices are killed, a law school student, along with many other people become curious and try to figure out "who dun it"...only, she writes a brief and hits the nail on the head, and when the wrong people find out, she's on the run for her life!I enjoyed the book mostly because it was fast-paced, and had a lot of detail.  So much detail and characters, I had a bit of a struggle to keep up!  Of course it was suspenseful and the characters, especially of Darby, the law school student and the reporter who starts to help her uncover the truth.  Good read
books||2.0||I usually enjoy Ms. Maron's Deborah Knott books very much. The characters are well drawn and give deep insight into Southern life. This one, however, is very flat and the characters are poorly drawn and one dimensional. The first murder doesn't seem to contribut anything to the storyline and is just "there". The second one involving Dwight's son (who is a very poorly developed child character) and his ex wife is not very interesting. I devoutly hope this was the nadir of the series and it will improve after this. Probably not, though-I foresee several storylines involving husband/stepmother/stepchild conflicts. Glad I checked it out from the library and didn't purchase it outright..do the same and don't waste your money

I read 'As I Lay Dying' in High School and hated it too.  There is no plot, and no point.  I hated it.

But, there hasn't been a playmate like TillyTilly since those nasties Henry James created in "Turn of the Screw."And, like them, TillyTilly seems to be something more than what a child has imagined.Jessamy Harrison, the eight-year-old daughter of a Nigerian mother and a British father, is a precocious and lonely child subject to screaming tantrums and panic attacks. During a visit to her Nigerian relatives, Jess explores an abandoned building and meets TillyTilly, a child of her own age, who she befriends. The problem is, no one else can see TillyTilly.On their return to England, TillyTilly mysteriously shows up and soon leads Jess into a heap of trouble. Fun becomes horror as Tilly demonstrates a penchant for cruelty.Given that Miss Oyeyemi was only 18 when she penned this complex novel, there are some drawbacks. Jess is often portrayed as much more sophisticated and articulate than the reader can believe and some characters are not drawn out enough. Despite these flaws, maturity is certain to give us a writer well worth watching for in the future.

books||5.0||This review is written from the perspective of a serious home cook that has been studying cooking for 25 years and concentrating on Italian cooking for the last 10 years.This book is targeted to anyone that wants to learn the history of Italian cooking. This book is full of both information and recipes.  This was one of my first Italian cookbooks, and is still one of my favorites.  This book is an authentic Italian cookbook not the Italian-American type that we are accustomed to in the USA.  If you want a good comprehensive book on authentic Italian food this is one of the books that I would recommend.However, if you are a beginner Italian cook, this is not the book for you.  The directions are written for someone that is familiar with the Italian kitchen.  The author assumes you have a basic knowledge of the Italian kitchen and typical recipes.One complaint, and it is minor, is the lack of glossy photographs that I have become so accustomed to in cookbooks.  The recipes in this book more than make up for the lack of photographs.Overall this book is highly recommended for those that are serious about Italian cooking

Fans of Gemmell and Jon Shannow might find the book a bit slow at first, and something of a retread of previous Jerusalem Man tales, but be patient...the master has got some great surprises up his sleeve!  Readers unfamiliar with Shannow are strongly advised to go back and read the previous Stones of Power books before this one.  You won't be disappointed.  Gemmell is one of the most important fantasy writers of the late 20th century

You can also use this book to design accents for a single room, or to craft an entire house. It was written by a German architect who  lived in Japan several decades ago and carefully measured surving older buildings as well as studying architecture there. While there are more detailed books in Japanese, this may well still be the best available book in English
books||1.0||What a disastrously bad and unfunny novel.  The self-involved main character is pathetic and whiny, the "plot" is see-through and cliched, and the writing style is far below what can be found on any mediocre blog.When people criticize chick lit, this is exactly the kind of book they're talking about.  It's shallow to such a shocking degree than when it tries to take itself seriously, or stretches for a literary flourish, it's absolutely cringe-worthy.  I find it hard to believe the people who've praised it here actually read the same book.This was given to me by an acquaintance shortly after my engagement.  She said she didn't really like it but thought it would be "more my kind of thing."  Obviously not a person who knows me well.  Thankfully, it doesn't appear the author is terribly prolific, so readers don't need to worry about trying to stumble through page after page of show-offy navel-gazing.I wouldn't say it's one of the worst books I've read, but it's certainly one of the most useless
books||5.0||This book offers such a fabulous collection of ideas.  The information and ideas one can gather from these pages is both a great way to trace the roots of feminism as well as to decide where we go from here.  Each section and piece has introductory information giving a setting of time, place and situation before the writers present their views.  There are so many ideas, ideals and beliefs that while not always agreeable or congruent, can be applied to today's feminist movement.  There is virtually nothing in the book that isn't valuable as either an example of progress or the seed of a new branch for the feminist tree.To understand the position in which women today navigate life, this book is essential reading.  Interesting, entertaining and informative, it ought to be required readin
books||5.0||Loved this book.  I think that this is a must-read for anybody working in a shelter or rescue situation.  The only negative comment is that the people who really need to read the book are not going to read it.  Working in the field, we see first-hand the changes that need to be made in our thoughts on animals. I wish that reading this book could be required before obtaining any animal. I will say that I cried during parts of the book
books||1.0||I do not think the man who "translated" the Koran here is a true Muslim. One cannot shuffle and reorder the Suras to suit one's own taste. This man does not have the right to mess up our Holy Book in this way. Plue the style of writing is not nearly as engaging as the Ali version. I have not been in a Mosque yet that had this version of the Koran on its shelves. You can go into any Mosque in this country and pick up a copy of the Ali Tranlation for free. Why waste your money on this Infidel sham version?
books||5.0||After seeing the movie, I decided to pick up the book.  This book proved to be very funny, as the protagonist wrestles with issues that many, many women her age face today.  Fielding ingeniously draws readers in with very true, often serious real-life topics (being single and not liking it, infidelity, betrayal)and is yet able turn it into light, funny reading.  That takes talent, in my book.  In the wrong hands, this novel could have been a very dreary book that no one would want to read(in light of the above topics).  You cant help but root for Bridget.I recommend this book and its sequel.  Most everyone will get a good laugh out of it
books||1.0||  I think the Linda Howard who wrote White Lies, Sarah's Child, Duncan's Bride, MacKenzies Mountain, Diamond Bay,etc. is one of the most talented current romance writers. Unfortunately, when she gave up the genre romances and turned to the "big Time", her writing started to decline. She is clearly in over her head now.  What a shame she couldn't stick to a format in which she excelled and warmed the hearts of millions of readers.  This just goes to show that one should figure out where one excels and stick to it. This is pure "Peter Principle" in action.Too bad

books||5.0||I was so impressed with this book that I wrote the following letter to its author:I just completed your book Time Tactics of Very Successful People.  The book is truly a masterpiece, and I have found it immeasurably helpful in my ongoing pursuit to become the best person that I can be.  Your book is full of wisdom and great ideas, the value of which is many times the price I paid for the book.  I have read the works of personal development legends like Napoleon Hill, Brian Tracy, W. Clement Stone, Tony Robbins, Mark Victor Hansen and others and have benefited from all of them, but I really enjoyed reading your book because I found that you offered some fresh ideas that these other great men did not. I am sure that the extraordinary concepts your book provides will enrich my spirit, enlighten my mind, and serve as conduits for achieving my goals for the rest of my life. I really liked the way that you ended the book.  The quote you gave from Earl Nightengale perfectly reflects my philosophy for successful living, but helped me crystallize my thinking in a way that has helped refines my philosophy further.   Thanks again for providing the world such a valuable resource, a guide which I am certain has helped and will continue to help many others to live happier, more productive, and more peaceful lives.
books||2.0||...you can waste your time and save your money by checking this out of your local library.If you want to get an "inside view" of the inner workings of Wall Street during the excessive gyrations of the '80s, then read Den of Theives - that book is well written and well worth the money!What turned me off about this book was the structure and the writing style.  The first half of the book was essentially the author relating fortuitous circumstances that were the product of Serendipity.  He was simply in the right place at the right time, had virutally no idea how he got there, felt out of place the whole time (even when he was raking in the Big Bucks in NY and London), and so now he thought he'd wwrite a book about it.  I also got the sense that he was trying to assuage some guilt from his association at Salomon Brothers.  He was there, he made a lot of money, good for him - get over it!I was also pretty disappointed because the subject matter has A LOT more potential.  I might have actually enjoyed it - had I not read Den of Theives 7 years earlier, and already had some idea of how things took place.  But, if you can get it for $5 or less (including shipping), and you have little to no knowledge of what an investment banker's life is like (and you haven't also seen the movie Wall Street (which covers the same highlights in this book)), then it's probably worth it.I did like the wrap up he did towards the end of the book, relating where he had heard everyone from the firm ended up...althought that seemed a little rushed..
books||5.0||I remember my father giving me this book when I was young.  He was a junior high school english teacher and used this book in class.  Together we read the stories and I loved them.  Now I am a college professor and use the book in class myself. While some of the summaries are "dated," they are still useful in communicating the basic action of the play to students and the very fact that they are "dated" allows the book to serve as an illustration of how interpretations of Shakespeare's plays have changed since the Lambs' time.I recommend this book heartily. 
books||1.0||I found the book informative while reading it, but also a bit confusing and a little dry, best used for a college course and not for recreational reading.  (Which is no doubt why we even had it in our house, someone had  to use it and it's equally boring companion for some college course, I'm  certain of it...
books||5.0||Greg Treverton has written a much needed overview of the national intelligence process and correctly identified the challenges which face the US, in a post-9/11 world.  His views of the world beyond 2010 are quite revealing and his challenges to the intelligence community to assess threats to the US are precisely focused. His views on the major intelligence entities reveal urgent modifications of structure and process, if the intelligence community is going to regain relevance with national customers.  As a teacher of intelligence process, specifically as it relates to strategic warning, I believe this book is essential reading for anyone who aspires to be a true intelligence professional. This book will help even the wisest analyst understand how to maximize available sources and methods.  The quest to provide the best possible intelligence is a goal which must be achieved.

books||5.0||This is not a book about management.  It is a wonderful exploration about how and why groups of individuals can and do make better decisions than individuals.  It sets out some necessary conditions for this wisdom to be able to take place and then does some excellent analysis of why that happens.  What I got out of this book was some very important ideas about why collaborative decision making is important and how to assure that it is done well (If you want the other side Irving Janis' old classic on Groupthink is a good counterpoint.)  Unlike a lot of other big idea books this one is very literate and readable.  It is a joy to read but it also offers some very substantive ideas
books||5.0||This book is full of useful insights.  I was fortunate to hear Reichheld present this content at a seminar for marketing professionals.  While some reviewers have complained that his approach is overly simplistic, I doubt any of them have actually applied his methodology to their business.  I applied his methodology to my business (direct selling) and had over 6,000 interviews completed to identify promoters, passives and detractors in the businesses of independent distributors.  Consistent with Reichheld's findings, the segments of my business that were growing fastest had more promoters in their respective customer bases and were performing better across a wide range of metrics.  From the detailed findings, we identified best practices that were leveraged across the entire business.  Buy the book.  Have an open mind.  Apply the concepts he has laid out.  If you do, you will walk away with useful ideas to accelerate the growth of your business

books||2.0||The book jacket for "The Ruins" offers a can't-miss premise:  a group of post-grad American tourists at play in Mexico jump at the chance for a little adventure among Mayan ruins but find but then find themselves in unimaginable danger.  It's the stuff of great Summer thrillers ready to be taken to the beach.  But 319 pages later, the reader is left to wonder whether or not the publisher put the wrong book in the jacket.  Almost immediately, you'll notice that Smith's writing is as dense as the jungles that make the setting.  However, despite the endless stream of words, his descriptions are often threadbare.  Plus, there are no chapter breaks, which eventually pushes the pace until it feels like an assignment to continue.  Next, the characters themselves begin to fall flat.  There are only really two couples to keep track of, and yet it's difficult for the first third of the book to distinguish them.  There is little to keep you interested in what they're doing or why they might be doing it.  Smith's attempts at developing these four as characters come in fits and spurts.  This seems obviously haphazard and hurried - the author is jamming in backstory whenever needed to explain characters' actions as if he were patching leaks in a dam.  By the end of the book, the foursome seems to be as disinterested in each other as the reader is in them.  And for the readers who are hoping to discover something of interest in the setting such as Mayan mythology or archeological lore, forget it.  Aside from language barriers with the locals, there is no reason why this fantastical story couldn't have been set in the wilds of the Rocky Mountains, the Saharan desert, or anywhere else.  The danger posed has nothing to do with Mexico, archeology or mythology at all.  Ah yes, the danger posed.  Well, I can't say much at all because anyone could give away the entire book with one line of explanation - that's how thin the plot is.  The numerous other reviews that fault this as a short story masquerading as a novel are exactly right.  Suffice it to say that when you do realize what the danger is (and you'll realize it well before any of the well-educated characters do), it's a real eye-roller, as if to say "I read this many pages for THIS?".By the time the story concludes, it's more irritating than suspenseful.  The characters take so long to blithely undertake any course of action at all that you'll start rooting against them.  Eventually scenes of gore start piling up in an obvious and lazy attempt to interject some action, but even aside from being misdirected, it's too little too late.  This book could have been an adventure, a supernatural thriller, a survival tale, or a horror screenplay.  It could have even taken the high road as an examination on people's reactions to situations of extreme stress:  some take the lead, even enjoying the challenge, while others whither into a shell of hopelessness.  But none of the possibilities ever come to fruition in this disappointing effort.

Mr Moyers will change the way of thinking for many as this disease has no limitations on the age in which this disease affects someone and all those around them.

books||1.0||Having read Clive Cussler adventures for over 10 years, i was totally disgusted with the redneck and narrow minded attitudes expressed in the book. The father, who does not stay with his son, decides to revenge his son fighting a war trying to kill people in someone else's country. That is perfectly justified!The book mentions Hindu mercenaries who have not been seen anywhere in the world in any century much less this one. This is a direct insult to all Hindus as being one I am astonished at the insensitivity of the author. How come "Hickman" is not a "Christian" mercenary or for that matter the Corporation as they seem to be in this for the money. The justifications are ridiculous. India and Hindus of India have been terrorized, jailed, colonized and robbed by Christian and Muslims alike over the last 1000 plus years. You don't find us calling people by religion and we have all major religions in our secular country. We have grown spiritually to accept everyone, and I would like the authors to read more than a 2 page synopsis on religions before writing books. The book smacks of jingoism and is a pathetic display of the authors minimal knowledge of religions and global affairs

books||1.0||Don't waste your money on this book. I will finish the book because it is our book club choice. The characters are shallow and  self centered. The writing is middle school quality. Kris Radish seems to have an agenda she is pushing and she was going to get it all into this book come hell or high water. No poetry and no beauty, I could care less about the women in this book. Who could possibly think life's problems could be solved by walking away from them while drinking lots of wine? I treasure my sisters and women friends but I wouldn't want to be a friend to any of these women. I would give it no stars if I could
books||5.0||"Spring Snow" is unquestionably one of the finest Japanese novels ever written, as well as being a masterpiece of world literature in its own right.  It is an eloquent, moving story with a "tale as old as time," that of star-crossed lovers who's love transcends social roles and obligations.In another culture, with another writer, this would be a romantic, if not happy, story.  But this is Japan, and the writer is Mishima Yukio.  In his hands, the lovers Kiyoaki and Satoko transcend literary stereotypes, and become agents of their own happiness and destruction.  By the very nature of their relationship, raised together since childhood, playing a complicated cat-and-mouse game of love and sexual tension, their future is never in doubt.  It is impressive that a writer such as Mishima, known for his right-wing politics and his samurai dreams, could craft such a tender love story.  While knowing the eventual conclusion, the reader savors and hopes for each stolen moment of happiness between Kiyoaki and Satoko, and knows that even their despair is something to be treasured because it is shared.    Not that it is a clear path.  Even knowing Japanese literature, and the road it usually takes, there are surprises on the way.  Things do not turn out the way one would expect.  I was incredibly moved by "Spring Snow."  It is a novel that affects the heart of the reader, and lingers long after the last page is turned. 
books||5.0||John Little and Peter Sisco wrote static contraction... but John takes it a step further and eliminates the need for doing reps with scientific explanations to back up his revolutionary concept of weight training/ muscle building.. My girlfriend and I started doing this method in may of 2005 and I can honestly say i've never found such a fast, quick and easy way to build muscle. This is also a great method for those not wanting to spend hours in a gym... after a while, you only need to workout once a week... but don't forget to stretch afterwards... and don't forget to do cardio on other days.I've never been able to develop the 6pack abs until I used the techniques in this book... not to mention all the other muscles popping out that I never knew were there before! I don't entirely agree with his take on supplements - although I think he's referring to all the stupid gimmicks out there designed to waste your time and money. Apparently he's not familiar with Shaklee
books||5.0||I agree with the first reviewer: this is what art criticism, politically engaged or not, should read like.  Berger was an old-time Marxist; I am an Anglosphere conservative.  He is a man of the Left; I am of the Right.  No matter, his essays are the most wonderful introduction to art criticism, and at times philosophy, that I have read.  Incredibly perceptive, sensitive, without empty sentimentality but filled with genuine sentiment and deep empathy for the human condition, Berger can make any painting or work of art say more than even its author may have intended.  He uses history but is not a historicist, for  he lets the works reveal themselves openly.  The essay "That which is held," a philosophic vindication of romantic love through an analysis of "time" is a near masterpiece of the essay form worthy of Montaigne.  Berger  will be missed in the barren landscape of contemporary Europe.  Danto and the Americans are simply not in his league

What I got was a less than thrilling re-hash of some of his best quotes as seen through the eyes of a local news reporter.  You'd have to be a true Blue Devil fan to like this book.  I didn't, so I gave it to one of my co-workers who graduated from Duke.  He likes it
books||2.0||I appreciate anyone's attempts to examine the deeper nature of life and share that with the rest of us. However, I could see a hole in Csikszentmihalyi's attempt from the beginning. "In the course of my studies I tried to understand as exactly as possible how people felt when they most enjoyed themselves, and why. My first studies involved a few hundred "experts"--artists, athletes, musicians, chess masters, and surgeons, in other words, people who seem to spend their time in precisely those activities they preferred."I'm surely not alone in wondering why on earth one would presume the above professions are strictly happy and "optimal experience". Particularly the reference to artists and musicians, who typically have severe struggles with life, and aren't on cloud nine just because some professors might like them in a couple hundred years. That is what I felt was the very weak point of the book--a study of happiness with almost no reference to unhappiness. It goes on to talk about ways to find flow in our ordinary life, while dodging the bullet continually about why if flow was all those great people needed, did they still encounter countless problems and unhappiness.
books||5.0||I think one of my major problems was the level of opinion being shotat the reader in the book. But then at times that made the book moreentertaining - its acerbic opinion of the right, how Reagan gettingelected made her feel stupid about being American, a funny British couple. The description of small details from each of the characters' childhood was something Icould relate to because i think of that myself. There were clevertidbits from anthropology, and economics, and generally all fields ofintellectual inquiry, all somehow connected with the patchwork of loveand relationships, and thus brain meets heart and you end up withsomething almost like the Bible for our times. The focus on the maincharacter made it so that every detail about him was described.Anyway, I am rambling, so, a note about the ending:I did find myself thinking this is getting very strange as the bookgot towards the ending. It might have made more sense if Nelsonactually was interested in the new girl the narrator finds for him,and the story then comes full circle. It would end in a nice ironicsort of way. However, his rejecting her makes in my mind for whatwould be a bad traditional ending. I don't mind this, since the onetime I wrote a story for a creative writing course I ended up with aterrible traditional ending. Now, could he have been anything otherthan a mystic? I felt that there was some hint towards Hinduism andspirituality building up towards the end. He mentioned India andHinduism unexpectedly and repeatedly at one point in the book. So hisbecoming a mystic was alluding perhaps to the ashramas - and histransition from intellectual worker to a mystical worker to eventuallya sage, as he attains Nirvana and becomes the Buddha of our times. Soin this way an ending emphasizing the spiritual, is perhaps the best.In line with the book, the spiritual is the eternal, and onlyaccessible through life-changing (near-death) experience. What you dofrom 25-50 (making a model village in rural Africa) is transient (cannever be perfect; infighting; hunting; guns; the "dark-side" of humannature will come back even in Utopia; i like the flexible hours; workwhen you want; accumulate credits; do manual labor once in a while;start the day with reading , not the end when you are tired; siesta,fiesta etc.) no matter how good you are. The girl herself is secondaryto the book - ironic since the book promotes feminism, is written by aguy with a female narrator but a male protagonist, who she is fixatedon and has doubts about. But in the end the Jesus character is stillmale. While the female goes back to Palo Alto and takes an average jobin service of the savior. The Man has the final laugh.Do you favor a better ending
books||2.0||I'm really a great fan of Douglas Coupland, which is perhaps much of the reason I found this book so disappointing. I hate the fact that it has been dubbed the new Microserfs, since it totally lacks the insight, wit and 'funny because its true' apsects of the original. About the only thing it has in common with  Microserfs is the fact that its set in the same industry. jPod is set in a landscape of unreality, with no apparent reason than to make a series of whacky adventures for eccentric, and for the most part unlikeable, characters. It certainly doesnt reflect the IT industry of today, and the members of the jPod really only seem to represent those aspects of this community which give programmers a bad reputation, as essentially dysfunctional (autistic) as they are. There doesnt even seem to be any real focus for this story. I felt like I was mostly reading about a heap of stuff that 'happened'.Its not all bad, and there were more than a few humorous moments, and interesting plot twists. Coupland's highly approachable and fast moving writing style hasn't changed. Its really just the subject matter and whatever its trying to communicate that seems to have fallen in a heap, in this book. I normally devour all of his books within a day or two, and want to read them again soon after, but it was a real struggle just to get through this one to the end
books||5.0||This book was extremely well written. It's a gorgeous story and not cliched at all. What totally gets me is that after searching the web for a time, I have not been able to find anyone that has written on the connection between her book and the eugenics movement taking place in the 20's. She most bluntly did not agree with eugenics at the end. For example, on page 233, "And if all the gifts of Life are good, perhaps, too, are all the shapes she chooses to take, and which we cannot alter." The book is filled with hints at the time period even though, after looking at countless reviews, the reviewers keep commenting on how her other books took from the time period and historical events and that Lud-in-the-Mist did not and it was a "fantastical" piece of literature. In my opinion, this book was TOTALLY based on the time period. There's even a line by the blacksmith about how since he's not "white" anymore he has come down in the world. If you're looking for a cultural artifact of the 20's, this is an astounding piece

The pictures of the drinks are so tempting and beautifully done that you are warmed up just by flipping through the book!  Most of the recipes in this book are alcohol based, so don't pick this book up looking for lots of kid-friendly drinks (though there are definitely some that kids would enjoy, such as a s'mores hot chocolate).  The recipes are all simple and there is a nice section on creating garnishes.  Order this book and get ready to sit back and enjoy some tasty, piping hot drinks

Gallery owner Rogan Sweeney takes an interest in Maggie's fabulous glass creations, and soon after takes a personal interest in Maggie herself.  Maggie is a wonderful character, stubborn and flawed, yet still caring.  Nora does a fabulous job of developing Maggie, and does it in a way that she seems like a real person.  Rogan is an extremely likeable hero.  Maggie's sister, Brianna, is her complete opposite; quiet, sweet, and calm.  The relationship between the two sisters, however, is very touching and very real.  This book is full of colourful characters, some we love and some we hate.  The romance between Rogan and Maggie is wonderful.  Basically, I just can't say enough good things about this book.  You will love it
books||2.0||This is a liberal's study bible.  The study notes show the best 'modern' scholarship, which doubts Moses wrote the first 5 books of the bible.  Doubts the authorship of most of Paul's Epistles.  Even doubts that the beloved disciple John wrote the Gospel of John.Believes Redactionary Interpretive Theory is valid.  Falls right in line with most modern and so called 'higher' critisim of the Bible.  Avoid this study bible, if you believe the Bible is really God's word from cover to cover

books||5.0||While not written at the level of technical philosophical detail as Aquinas or Pannenberg (as another review here stresses), this text is still set apart from most general theological treatments by its philosophical clarity and coherence.  This is in addition to the virtues of its serious treatment of the range of Scriptural data concerning each topic, its apologetic engagement with differing views, and its practical counsel for life and ministry.  It is a great resource for thinking through major theological issues and positions.  I recommend it highly

books||5.0||Many novels of the African-American experience in the United States use the theme of "passing". These novels generally involve a light-complexioned African-American who can "pass" for white.  Among other things, novels based on a theme of "passing" allow the character and the author to comment upon black-white relationships in the United States from both sides -- from the black experience and from the white experience.Both white and black authors have made extensive use of the theme of "passing".  The earliest novel involving "passing" of which I am aware is by William Dean Howells in his short 1891 book, "An Imperative Duty" which dealt with an inter-racial marriage.  The African-American novelist Nella Larsen wrote a novel titled "Passing" set in the Harlem Renaissance.  More recently, Philip Roth's novel "The Human Stain" involves the story of Professor Coleman Silk, a distinguished academic and student of the classics who passes for many years as white.Coleman Silk is the successor to the protagonist of James Weldon Johnson's only novel, "The Autobiography of an ex-colored Man" written in 1912.  The unnamed protagonist of the book is an individual, like Roth's character Coleman Silk, with great intellectual and artistic gifts who is torn between the opportunities open to him as an, apparently, white person and his strong sense of black identity.  Like Coleman Silk and the characters in most novels involving the theme of "passing", Johnson's protagonist marries a white woman and lives a life plagued with guilt regarding his abandonment of his heritage as an African-American. Johnson's short novel is, to my mind, the best written on the theme of "passing", and it is a fine novel indeed. The book initially was published anonymously.  The writing is so powerful and believable that many readers took the book for a true autobiography until Johnson acknowledged his authorship in 1914.  Many years later, Johnson wrote his own autobiography, titled "Along This Way" in part to show that the story of his own life was not the story of the protagonist in the "Autobiography".Johnson's story shows how his protagonist goes back and forth, both internally and in the outward events of life, about whether to make his way in the white or in the black world.  He ultimately finds himself successful but unhappy. In addition to the story line of the book, Johnson uses the "passing" theme to allow many reflective passages by characters in the book on racial relationships in the United States early in the 20th Century.  The most famous such scene occurs as the protagonist travels in a "smoking car" for whites on a train in the segregated South.  He participates in a discussion among several white men of varied backgrounds on the "race question" as it was viewed at the time.  There is also a chilling scene in the book involving a lynching, the burning alive of a black person.  Johnson worked fervently in the latter years of his life to secure the passage of anti-lynching legislation in Congress.But Johnson's novel includes a great deal more than a consideration of race issues.  The book offers an outstanding picture of life in early twentieth Century America -- in the South and in Johnson's beloved New York City.  The book is filled with pictures of dives and gambling dens and of the trade of cigar making in both South and North.  It is filled with the love of the piano and of classical music.  Most strikingly, the book has the spirit and feel of ragtime, which reached the height of its popularity during the years in which the book appeared.  Johnson shows great appreciation for this product of American culture.The book also illustrates some universal themes.  The protagonist is troubled, specifically, by the conflict between his identity as an African-American and his wish to succeed as a white person.  But the broader themes of the book are the consequences of lack of self-knowledge, the role of chance in human life, and the consequences of a certain sense of purposelessness and frustration, which plague many individuals separately from any consideration of race.  Johnson develops these themes eloquently and ties them in well with his theme of "passing".Johnson's novel is an important work of American fiction which deserves to be read.
books||1.0||I found the book very difficult to use and almost never had what I was looking for.  The small dictionary in the back of my eyewitness travel guide was much more useful
books||2.0||Perhaps this book appeared to be a futuristic medical thriller when it first came out, but now it seems like a bad 1950s horror movie.  The story involves brain surgery gone bad, with a mix of artificial intelligence and mind control.  The end of the story was very predictable and played out exactly as I suspected from the very beginning of the book.
books||4.0||I lived in a situation somewhat like that Richardson describes.  We watched VietNam from 1000 miles away, but the players were the same.  It was like living at the far edge of the Welsh Marches in the time of the Roman Empire.  Maybe if you haven't lived within a bureauocracy you won't understand, but everything he says is true

books||1.0||The title is a misrepresentation.  This is not a handbook for driving a Porsche quickly or professionally.  I bought this book because in 2 months I am going to drive my rear engined 993 on a F1 circuit.  I have no circuit experience, and cannot get any coaching or any circuit experience in the country I live in.  Since this is a rear engined car which I have little experience with I was particularly wanting some tips particular to rear engined cars.  There is nothing in the whole book which is particular to driving Porsches or rear engined cars.  The only reason I will not throw this book out is because it has some interesting 1960's and early 19970's Porsche racing pictures (poor quality black and white though).  Also to be fair there are some good racing stories. He is undoubtedly a very impressive driver having been successful at the highest levels in rallying and sports prototype endurance racing.  A better title would be "My Porsche Racing History".  If you want a book on fast driving I would highly recommend Ross Bentley's "Speed Secrets" in place of this book

It's like watching a top notch horror/mystery movie.  This has got to be my most favorite book of any by anyone.  I still recommend it to people after reading it quite a few years ago now.  I give this book a 5++++ star rating
books||2.0||PROS: 1. John Corey is still a funny, memorable character.CONS: 1. Very little suspense. The author's use of a doomed character's point of view--switching to third person--to tell the reader all of the hows and whys of the main villain's Dr. Evil-esque plan ("FIRE THE NUKE!"). Then, after we know everything, we get plopped back into the first-person, investigative head of Corey, who doesn't yet have the story solved. The result is predicatable and tedious.2. The don't-look-behind-the-curtain (gratuitous?) use of the Ted Nash character, who makes a brief appearance at the end...despite having died in NIGHTFALL...and, uh, THE LION'S GAME. Why is Ted's appearance so brief here? Well, he admits to screwing Ms. Mayfield. Naturally, Ms. Mayfield opens fire and fills Ted with bullets. Presumably, Ted's dead for good now. 3. The politics of DeMille's novels has been present in other books, but it's never been this catty. Why is the nuke kook a right-winger? (Hey, why not?) I should have known when the jacket cover said the book "will challenge you to question everything you thought you knew about your leaders and your country." The only thing this book has made me question is how anyone can seriously be more worried about conservatives nuking L.A. and San Francisco than the real terrorists out there...the ones who want to slit throats and post the footage on the web.  4. Continuity problems from how the last book, NIGHTFALL ended...Corey and his wife seem way too disaffected by it all. Yep, they are bothered by 9/11, but they are both working their same jobs, apparently having gotten over the whole sickening coverup (witnessed via videotape) that the "accident" of the TWA flight 800 was really caused by a missile. There is passing reference to this, but not much. Apparently, a guy like Corey doesn't do much soul searching. He just keeps going to work. In realilty, it's hard not to notice that DeMille still doesn't know how to deal with the storytelling hole he got himself in with the last book.Corey is really all this book has going for it. And, while in his capable hands the world will be saved from kooky nuclear schemes from kooky Republicans, he can't save this book.I think I'm done with DeMille, for better or for worse
books||2.0||This is a revolutionary book. It introduces the stage metaphor into sociology; all of social interaction is a performance on a stage. It's questionable how novel this metaphor is, but this is certianly its first explicit statement. The language used to present the ideas of the author is, like most sociological writing, unecessarily complicated. There are some problems with clarity and structure; the book just doesnt have a holistic feel for me. No sociological background is presupposed, there is extensive quoting from other sociological sources, many footnotes, and various other ways to enter sociological literature throught the book. So if you are interested in reading sociology, this is probably a good place to start (again, the language is unecessicarily thick and this may be it's bane as an introduction).However, the book is misguided. The idea of viewing social interaction as a performance on a stage is unecessary. The authors motives for saying this will make my position clearer.(The following is a charicature of the author's argument). There is certianly a large amount of social behavior which is directed towards other people (the audience) in order for the audience to build an impression of the actor. Well, if it can happen here we can draw a parallel with other situations, infact all situations and therfore all of social interaction is like a performance on a stage, "All the world is not, of course, a stage, but the crucial ways in which it isnt are hard to specify" (p 72). The performances can either be with individuals, or groups of people, and they can be performing conciously or unconciously. (end of charicature)There are other arguments, obviously, and the statement "we can draw a parallel with other situations" is most of the content of the book, which i dont like to gloss over with a sentence. But the real question here is, is the view worthwhile? My answer: No. Social interaction is a complex phenomena that cant possibly be summed up with a signle metaphor. Yes, some social interaction is like a performance, where indivudals are intentionally making impressions on one another. Yes, some social behavior can arise from unconcious beliefs. However, most social interaction is exactly the way we see it, conciously controlled, meaningful, purposeful interaction with individuals; it is not some kind of performance with the purpose of creating a "reality".I hope my view of the book is clear so that the biases on the final part of my review can be sorted out: the book is a waste of time. Where the author is right, the statement is little more than common sense. Where the author goes outside of common sense, he's wrong, sometimes plainly so. This book is part of the tradition in sociology of thinking that society pulls the wool over each individuals eyes, that reality is a social construct with no purpose other than social control (here the wool is the performance, and the control has to do with impressions ... but this quickly degenerates into an obscure mess of assertions). There is no real empirical support given for most of the claims. Where "evidence" is given, the evididence is so heavily intepreted that it fails to correspond to facts in the world but rather to facts about the views of the reporter. Where there is no correspondence to the world there is no truth. Various sources of sociology are cited, but this is more like intellectual bullying. Saying that some author, which also didnt have any empirical support for his claims, agrees with you is just to bully your reader into acepting your claims. The claims in the book have no practical application in the world, but only serve to intepret situations differently, and in personal opinion, less correctly. Nothing said here will lead to better predictions about social behavior or a better understanding of psychology. In short, this isnt a scientific study at all. My final qualm with the book deserves its own paragraph, the use of language. The best example is the definitions given at the end of the introduction "A performance may be defined as all of the activity of a given participant on a given occasion which serves to influence in any way any of the other participants" (15). This is a curios definition. Me breathing while i work is a performance, it changes the percentages of O2 and CO2 in the atmosphere near my co-workers. Me staring into space is a performance, other people see me stare into space and are therefore influenced. Infact, me simply existing is a performance, since my existance causes a gravitational effect on the other participants, as well as influencing them to create beliefs about me existing. Its as if Goffman created a definition for performance which included all possible actions taken by any person, and then wrote a book about how all possible actions taken by any person fall under the category of performance. He didnt. He used a word that we associate with controlled behavior (performance) and defined it in a way no one is used to. Then he used alot of word play to show that behavior has no substance, its all for the purpose of maintaining social reality. I hope this very limited example shows the terrible use of language that is endemic to Goffman and sociology more generally.So an ode to sociology is in order ... actually no it isnt. Why wont this subject go away? This book is an integral part of sociology, and it espouses the methods and style of sociological researchers and writers by being an archetypical work within the tradition. The methods are questionable; the style is obscure. Like it or hate it, sociology is a part of modern thought. Read the book to be an educated person and keep in mind its intellectual failings
books||4.0||When Peter S. Lynch speaks, wise investors will listen.  This book covers the famous fund manager's career at the helm of Fidelity Magellan from 1977 to '90, and post career into '92.  It's far more introspective than "One Up On Wall Street" and it was no doubt meant to be for this purpose.  For example, there isn't nearly as much fundamental principles for stock picking outlined in this book as the former.  My belief is that the reader would do best by reading "One Up On Wall Street" first and follow up with this title, as its the newer of the two, regardless. Peter's style of writing (with John Rothchild) is no-nonsense and easy to take in.  To my knowledge three books have been published by the duo and all three have been entertaining and never dry.  The reader can comfortably take in some very important stock-picking principles from one of the greats without feeling intimidated at any point.  I think this is a sign of a well written book that covers a topic that isn't child's play (unless you like playing with money).And although this book doesn't cover nearly as much technical information as the first, it still offers a lot of tasty tidbits for stock pickers.  I made plenty of notes while reading "Beating The Street", and I'm confident that I'll be well served by doing so.  Peter reiterates many of the guidelines he mentioned in his first best-seller, such as scrutinizing company earnings and the balance sheets, and he gives his wise opinion of picking bargain stocks that have lower P/Es than their growth rates.Overall, this title definitely deserves four stars, and his first book deserves at least five stars.  Lynch and Rothchild have authored several investing books that will stand the test of time. You'll sleep better with your investment decisions by having these valuable classics in your collection.  
books||5.0||I have been a fan of Larry Gonick`s work for years ever since I first stumbled onto his Cartoon Guide to Statistics.  He covers a subject the way it should be covered-historically.  Innovations in science and math have moved along together in a historical time line.  It was this historical approach that made Carl Sagan's Cosmos series one of the greatest innovations in the effort to popularize science.I have long said that we teach science backward.  We still teach on a 19th Century model.  We start with biology, then chemistry, and finally physics.Even when I was in high school, I wished that I could take physics before chemistry.  Before I was elected as a school board director, I was on our district's Gifted Advisory Council.  I made the suggestion that we teach physics before chemistry and, then, biology last.  I was immediately shot down by one of the other parents on the basis that sophomores do not have the math courses under their belts to tackle physics.  So why not teach the math along with the science?  Integrate it.  (No, that would make it too relevant.)I felt vindicated when a friend of mine reported that she attended a lecture by a Nobel laureate making the same assertion that I had been making for years-we teach science backwards.  After all, the toughest course out there is biochemistry-at least that is what every med student I know has ever said.  And biochemistry is the new frontier for blockbuster innovations-nano-technology not being the least of these frontiers.Gonick underscores my assertion about teaching physics first, because in this book on chemistry, he introduces quantum mechanics, which is normally taught as physics, on page 28.Don't let he word "cartoon" in Larry Gonick`s books fool you into thinking that these are easy fluff surveys of the subjects involved.  He makes each subject accessible while being entertaining, but each book stands on its own as a complete basic survey course of the subject.So when I needed to add about two dollars to my order to get free shipping, it took me about thirty seconds to find my book.  I went right to Larry Gonick
books||1.0||As a Certified Information Systems Security Professional, I can definitively state that this book does not cover everything that needs to be covered or in any depth whatsoever. I got this book based on the glowing reviews I found here, and I'm at a loss as to why these reviews would have recommended it.The most aggrevating part about this book is the subtitle "An Integrated Approach to Security in the Organization." The book not only lacks effective security integration techniques, it doesn't seem to address the entire organization where it tries its half-hearted integration.
books||2.0||For decades, African-American studies scholars have left issues facing non-heterosexuals to the side.  For years, "queer" scholars have left concerns of people of color to the side.  This anthology tries to address that void.  It goes a long way in proving that black, gay academics can be just a rigorous and hardcore as white gay ones or straight black ones.  The anthology has representative numbers of men and women.  In some ways, it's a Who's Who of Black Gay Academia, including works from Cathy Cohen, Dwight McBride, and Jewelle Gomez.Still, there is much about this book that frustrated me.  A few years ago, a study was done of black LGBTs and most respondents said they hated the term "queer," yet the academics here champion it.  Really, if "queer" is supposed to represent the four groups equally, then this book was quite lacking in its coverage of bisexuals and the transgendered.  This is surprising given famous black bisexual writers such as Alice Walker, Stuart Hall, and June Jordan.  Often "people of color" is used when only blacks are brought up; Latinos, Asians, and Native Americans barely come up in this book at all.James Baldwin is brought up often here.  I understand that.  His writings were rigorous and often dealt with racial and sexual issues simultaneously.  Still, I kept thinking about how bell hooks once wrote that Toni Morrison gets a lot of attention when publishers won't print the works of black women that are equally as sophisticated.  James Baldwin deserves his crown in black, gay letters, but I'm concerned about him being the only one to get to wear a crown.  Several books have been printed about the many non-hetero members of the Harlem Renaissance, yet that group hardly comes up here.  James is getting a bit played out and the authors here are not helping change that tendency.Finally, I had beef with many of the essays.  Charles Nero has great points but his essay is really two works glued together.  Can anyone really say the whiteness of New Orleans' "gay ghetto" is due to "Chasing Amy" or "Six Feet Under"?  One author could have written quickly about how he supported a gay, feminine student when that student was condemned by a masculine, heterosexual one.  Instead, he went on and on in unnecessary jargon and babble.  Kara Keeling's essay was 90% theory and 10% a discussion of Dunye's "Watermelon Woman."  Why bother to bring up the film if you're barely going to discuss it?I wasn't really feelin' this text, but that's not to say it didn't have great aims
books||5.0||In Faith in Nation, Anthony Marx delivers a spirited rebuttal of the "literary trope" (p 15) about a liberal, inclusive Western nationalism. Instead, he argues that even the "truest" brand of Western nationalism-that of England and France-came to being only after brutal fratricide of massive scale. His entire theory is based on a central position that nationalism developed much earlier than is popularly believed today. This leads one to question why does he insist on such a position? Has he made the case for it? What happens to his theory if the position turns out to be wrong? I will argue that the definition of the state, or the lack thereof, is key to answering all of the above questions. Only by implicitly loosening the definition of the state, can Marx trace the genesis of Western nationalism back to as early as the 16th century, thus cementing the linkage between Western nationalism and religious violence. However, the liberal adaptation of the concept of the state puts Marx's entire theory on shaky ground.  According to Marx, the state is the raison d'tat of nationalism: for nationalism to become a historical force, it "must ... refer to a state as an existing structure or potential object of engagement" (p 8). Although he declares early and clearly what nationalism is (p 4), he never spells out his definition of a state. In fact, what we would think of as a modern state today can hardly be found in 16th century Europe. Only when the definition of a state is sufficiently loosened, can Marx backdate nationalism to the 16th century, when most of the political authorities at the time existed in the form of royal courts. Only after he pushes back the genesis of nationalism, can Marx connect the religious violence of the 16th century to nationalism. Only when the religious violence is viewed as part of the history of nation building, does it acquire significance in the nature of Western nationalism. Otherwise, the St. Barthelme Day massacre or the burnings at Smithfield is just another "normal" religious upheavals in history, thus any association the massacre or the burnings may have with nation building would be purely coincidental-as Liah Greenfeld implied when Marx quoted her in saying, "Frenchness was disassociating itself from Catholicism." To Anthony Marx, however, French nationalism and its French Catholic identity are not external to each other. They are just different stages in the same dialectic process. Therefore, real "Frenchness" is actually the public oblivion in France of the strange relationship between the church and the state1. Yet all the grand reasoning depends on Marx's definition of the state. After all, can we call the royal courts of the 16th century "states"? Not only has Marx not given his readers a clear answer, some of his own writings seem to contradict each other. For example, Marx mentions that the Treaty of Westphalia marks the beginning of the modern states (p 35). But the French War of Religions and the reign of Mary Tudor-the very conflicts that are supposedly at the core of nation-state building-occurred almost a century earlier. Even if we use the later date, 1648, as the beginning of the state system, one still has to be cautious to label all subsequent political authorities "states". Regardless whether Louis XIV actually said "I am the state", the fact that monarchical authority is directly associated with an individual ruler makes it transient in nature (relative to institutionalized modern government), therefore it can hardly be designated the "object of engagement" for nationalist ideology. Since Marx's concept of the state is on shaky ground, his entire theory appears highly questionable. I would argue, however, there are two options that can salvage his arguments. One is to weaken the link between nationalism and the state. In other words, nationalism may develop independent of the state. This observation may have a wider application outside of the context of Western history than inside of it. The other option is to introduce a third element, such as political culture, that can bridge the violent past and state and nation building in later times. For example, one accepts that the massive fratricide did happen earlier than the emergence of the nation-state. Nevertheless, the bloodshed molded a new political culture, which manifested itself as a more inclusive nationalism when the nation-state took shape later. If such an interpretation proves to be a more sensible reading of history than that of Marx, then Marx's criticism of Western nationalism can be easily appropriated to deconstruct the Western political culture-the liberal democracy-itself: that it has a ugly past but short memory. However, is the world ready for such a "total recall"?

books||1.0||I can't remember the last time I failed to finish reading a novel.  I abandoned this one with 100 pages to go.  With another implausible plot twist, I've had enough.  Maybe I've been spoiled by the quality of character driven fiction from George Pelecanos, James Lee Burke, Robert B parker, James Sallis, Scott Phillips, and Robert Crais but I suspect that this is not just a failure to connect with the characters and more to do with poor writing.I've read quite a number of Deaver's novels and enjoyed the complex plots and the exploration of psychologically/psyciatrically devient chbaracters, but this is just over the top.  When I came to the chapter that excplained how the magician faked his death while in custody, that was enough.  I have another fifty novels lined up waiting to be read and I'll be damned if I'm going to waste any more time on this poor one.

books||1.0||What a bunch of high school hallway gossip! The author does not know the difference between white and albino! The 'genetics' discussions on color (which includes people, chickens, horses, and dogs - all of it suspect) and mutts vs. purebred dogs are total claptrap! I confess, I couldn't get past page 87 when the author explains that 'one of the reasons wolves turned into dogs was that nursing human mothers probably adopted orphaned wolf cubs and nursed them at their breasts along with their human babies.' WHAT?? A waste of my hard-earned $. Having read those parts I cannot believe anything that went before or that follows, not that I'm reading any further. How is a multi-published author allowed to put such uneducated 'information' into print? And now she's influenced readers -- a terrible situation. Publisher, where are your pre-publication reviews? Shame on you for allowing this ignorant speculation to be published!
books||2.0||Mr. Winchester takes an interesting subject, collects enough material to make a fine article in, say, National Geographic, and somehow pads it out to several hundred pages in length.  (Case in point, a chapter devoted to how he found an interesting fossil by the seaside while a kid, but loses it, and his journey back to the site of this failure of his to wallow in the misery of this horrible loss. Ick. Self-induldgent.  Boring.)  Worse, still, even where there is a potential for interesting and enlightening material, such as relates, say, to the subject's wife, all Mr. Winchester bothers to give us are some gossipy speculations.  I guess extensive research might have been too time consuming.  Numerous times I considered stopping reading the book because the writing was so dreadful, but the subject was just interesting enough to keep me going, hence my review of two stars.  John McPhee could have covered the actual science of geology way better than Mr. Winchester, and just about any other author could have done a better job of telling the personal story
books||5.0||Background		I read Isaac's Storm, by Erik Larson, around 1998. Recently I had occasion to thumb through it again which has prompted this review. Larson covered three killer hurricanes, two killer blizzards and one flash flood.		Galveston and related Hurricanes	My first impression was that anyone who had read this book, about a major hurricane, would never consider riding out such a storm. Larson painted a frightening story of brick homes and brick schools being torn apart by the surging waters. Isaac Cline was the U. S. Weather Service Chief at Galveston at this time. This book gives much detail on the Galveston storm. This hit the island in September 1900, with very little warning. Indeed it was the arrogance of the U. S. Weather Service in general, and Issac Cline, their station chief for this area, in particular, that essentially preempted any warning. "Cline was one of the 'new men', a scientist who believed he knew all there was to know about the motion of clouds and the behavior of storms." First, the U. S. Weather Service refused to pay any attention to any inputs from Cuba. The U. S. Weather Service had men stationed in Cuba who "said the storm was nothing to worry about." Cuban's "own weather observers, who had pioneered hurricane detection, disagreed." Secondly the U. S. Weather Service insisted that, any storm warning had to come from the Washington office, with absolutely no exceptions. Finally Isaac had the conviction, and public position, that no hurricane could ever hit Galveston, as they would be steered north before reaching as far west as Galveston. With such a position Cline had no motivation to try and influence headquarters. 	Larson cited two older hurricanes in his book. * September 16, 1875 - "The storm raised an immense dome of water and shoved it through Indianola, pushing the waters of the Gulf and Matagorda Bay inland until for 20 miles the back country prairie was an open sea." This storm took 176 lives.* August 20, 1886 - This storm completed the destruction of Indianola. So many residents were killed that the survivors abandoned the town completely.	In 1891, "in the wake of a tropical storm that Galveston weathered handily" Cline  was asked to appraise the city's vulnerability to extreme weather. Isaac wrote: "The opinion held by some - - - that Galveston at some time will be seriously damaged by some such disturbance is simply an absurd delusion." He made this statement in spite of the fact that the maximum elevation of Galveston Island, at that time, was an almost trivial 8.7 feet above sea level. He made it also in spite of the two killer hurricanes hitting and destroying the town of Indianola, about 150 miles southwest of Galveston on Matagorda Bay.	Cline had a "model" of Gulf hurricanes, namely that no hurricane could ever hit Galveston, as they would be steered north before reaching as far west as Galveston. His "model" of these storms was clearly fatally flawed, or politically influenced, and it resulted in 6,000 to 10,000 deaths. 	Larson suggests there was a "scent of boosterism" behind this article, and that he was writing an article that Galveston promoters would be happy to see. Could this have been a harbinger of things to come? Could Cline have been the first government weather scientist to prostitute himself by writing favorable papers on the weather for his sponsors?	Then the storm hit. Both the U. S. Weather Service and Isaac Cline looked very arrogant before the storm, and also in defending their overall performance, after the storm.Other extreme weather events 	Larson also covered two blizzards and one flash flood in his book in this book.* Hail and flash flood, August 1885 - "a severe downpour near San Angelo, including hailstones the size of ostrich eggs, killed hundreds of cattle and created a flash flood with An escarpment of water that Isaac estimated to be 15 or 20 feet high."* Blizzard, November 1888 - this surprise blizzard destroyed 150 vessels off New England, and caused the death of 450.* Blizzard, January 1899 - "this blizzard swept much of the South. Icebergs 10 feet high flowed down the Mississippi past New Orleans." This storm even hit Galveston and piled snow on it's beaches and drove water out of the Bay into the Gulf exposing portions of the bay bottom.Conclusion	Isaac's Storm shows the incredoble wrath of hurricanes, 105 to 125  years ago. It also depicts the incredible spectrum of extreme weather events, also of the same vintage. All in all a most interesting and rewarding book, one that I would recommend highly.

Kincaid seemed relegated to a side character with Gemma taking the lead.  IN A DARK HOUSE is an excellent mystery that brings the two back to equal ground and re-establishes them as one of the best partnerships in mystery fiction
books||5.0||As I read, I kept trying to figure out whether this tale is a collection of reflections on how two religions can destroy a region and its people, whether the characters have broader agendas than their stories or whether it's just a good tale peppered with strong political images.  And, a good story it is.  How can you beat this writing?"The pandits of Kashmir were left to rot in their slum camps, to rot while the army and the insurgency fought over the bloodied and broken valley, to dream of return, to die while dreaming of return, to die after the dream of reture died so that they could not even die dreaming of it, why was that why as that why was that why was that why was that" (p. 297)"The beauty approached him, beckoning.  Her arm slipped around his shoulder, supple as a snake, and like a snake her leg coiled around his.  Then like a third snake her other arm and like a fourth snake her other leg until she was slithering all over him....  She had as many arms and legs as a goddess, and multilimbed and irrestible she coiled and tightened around him and, finally, with all the power she possessed, she bit.  The accidental death by king cobra snakebit of [the] General was announced ... the next morning and he was buried with full honors.... (p. 316)" p. 31
books||2.0||Toward the end of How Now Shall We Live, Chuck Colson states, regarding popular music and media, that a little cotton candy is permissible as part of a healthy diet. However, he warns, a diet of junk food can be fatal.Good advice concerning pop culture-but even more applicable to this book. Yes, it contains a kernel of truth, but it ultimately is dangerous if not balanced by a heavy diet of other thinkers and theologians such as Thomas Merton, St. Francis of Assisi, Ron Sider, Tony Campolo, Brian McLaren, Brother Lawrence, Philip Yancey, Wendell Berry-the list goes on. It often is guilty of oversimplifying the ideological conflicts the modern Church faces, drawing the lines down to "Christians" against the "naturalists" or "humanists," thus ignoring the wide range of threats that seek to destroy the Church.While there is truth in Colson's writing, I believe it ultimately stems from a flawed worldview-one defined largely by comfortable middle-class American thought and militaristic nationalism, sprinkled with the politically correct amount of Christian belief. His faith seems to be overly academic, one that favors rhetoric and proof over prayer and other spiritual disciplines. Evangelism, it seems to Colson, is comprised heavily of apologetics. The secularists must be shown that they are wrong, he says. Yes, there is truth and there is time for debate, but this book seems to prefer winning debates over building bridges and relationships. You see, I used to fear evolutionists and the proverbial round table of "secular humanists" that many conservative evangelicals love to discuss. But as I've grown, I realize that threats to the Church come more often from within than from secular culture, and they almost always have more to do with power and politics than the Enlightenment or science.
books||2.0||Amazingly tedious for a thriller.  Reacher is a good character, believable in his expertise, but a bit cold blooded in his use of violence. The book takes too long to tell everything (and I mean everything) - it seems every minute of the week long plot is chronicled as is every thought Reacher has (many repeated over and over). I hope Child fixed these flaws in later books.
books||5.0||I found this novel at a bookstore on the boardwalk I visit at least once every summer.  I love going there and looking to see if I can find a book that I have never heard of, by an author I've never heard of, and buy it on a whim.  This is the novel I bought last year.  I has, unfortunately, sat on my shelf since then until tonight, because of many reasons.  Tonight, however, I picked it up and read it cover to cover.  The narrative was brilliantly told, the dialogue completely believable and the plot totally heartwrenching.  If I had made it to the end without some tears, I would believe myself made of stone!  Skip is a character many can relate to: a man unsatisfied with how his life has turned out, down about how his friends have really not been friends at all, that gets the chance to do something great by this little child.  However, it is the change she makes in those around her which are truly the BLESSINGS of the title.  Faith, a name not used lightly, restores her namesake in all those touched by her.  She ultimately gives him the chance  of making something of his life without even knowing it.  Many BLESSINGS occur in this wonderful novel, and I found myself all at once sour about how humankind can be at times, but also proud at how humankind can be at others (which is a fact, in itself, that proves how well Quindlen has spun her tale).  The fact is that just because a person has been to jail, has deadbeat friends, does not mean he is of that same stock; just because an elderly woman has become so dragged down by her own life does not mean she has no feeling left in her.  Skip, Lydia, Nadine, Meredith, Jennifer...all have many dimentions to their characters that Quindlen has spectacularly drawn
books||1.0||F this self-help industry crap. Quasi-astrological poppycock at its worst. I can tell this book clamps on to the mind and squeezes it to death merely by reading the cliched title. Humans are far more complex than the hack Man-Warrior/Female-Maiden title what's-his-name gives them. And remember, this "doctor," is quietly making mucho mucho bucks off your poor purchase. Your goddamned ancestors never needed a book to run their lives, so why do you? Let's push all the life coaches off cliffs and put the self-help industry to the torch. That's a great start to a sane life
books||1.0||This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck.
books||5.0||My son had visited several colleges, and was having a terrible time figuring out which ones he would "fit in" and get the best educational experience from. He ended up reading this book and visited a few of them that he liked the descriptions of. After applying to, and getting accepted at, four of the schools in this book (and two not in the book) he ended up at Denison University. He's in his second year, and just loves it. I've always felt a little "indebted" to this book, so I thought I'd leave this review
books||1.0||Sheppard's attempt to capture the "American youth angst" failed miserably. Instead what he created was a novel that felt more like a chore to get through.  I never developed any connection or understanding of the characters.  Each chapter seemed to stumble into the next, with the end as predictable as the next expletive Sheppard was going to use to give his protagonists a hard edge.  You'd do better saving your money, driving to the nearest mall, and find the kid in the Anarchy T-shirt looking sullen, because it appears that is all Sheppard did in this work.  Phew Stinker-rooney!  
books||1.0||If Tony Hillerman wrote this novel (novella actually), I sure can't tell. I have been a Chee/Leaphorn fan for many years, but this novel is not in the same league with Hillerman's other work. It is reminiscent of a 'B' movie. Instead of building suspense, the plot is laid out all too plainly, the characters are unreal, and the Chee/Bernie romance doesn't ring true.  I am amazed that it was published
books||2.0||...are incorrect and that his fractal models are much better. Of course if his models were worth more than the paper they're written on Mandelbrot wouldn't have to write books like this because he'd be cleaning out everyone else's wallets on the stock market. In particular, if it's true that extreme events are more unlikely than most people think then he could easily exploit this with a suitable derivative. But the fact is, Mandelbrot doesn't know anything that countless other traders don't already know. So instead Mandelbrot is forced to resort to telling people how smart he is through his books rather than actually being smart enough to make a killing on Wall Street.But I am glad I read this book. Having seen Mandelbrot 'on tour' a few years ago I developed a strong prejudice against him. But reading this book has convinced me that my prejudice is entirely justified. He can never just state a fact. Instead he always has a to phrase it as "my work shows that..." or "I demonstrated that..." even if he makes the same claim again and again. If he can try to take credit for other people's work he'll do so. He even managed to find someone to write an introduction for the book who was prepared to refer to the Levy distribution as the Mandelbrot-Levy distribution. The most egregious example of self-aggrandisement has to be the caption to a picture of the Brooks-Metelsky-Mandelbrot set where he mentions that two mathematicians only scaled part way up his 'Everest' of this set and received Fields medals for this work - the implication of course being that Mandelbrot has actually seen the view from the summit. Disgustingly he doesn't even deign to mention the names of these mathematicians.One time I criticised Mandelbrot publicly and someone responded by pointing out how many peer reviewed papers he had published so he can't be all bad. But in this book Mandelbrot actually reveals to us how he used his social network to work around the peer review system. Astonishing!I think it's also worth pointing out that there are some interesting ideas in this book and so it's not completely valueless. But I found the discussion of multifractal time methods (which make up a large part of the book) to generate plausible looking but fake price charts to be a bit pointless. I work in computer graphics and use similar methods to generate random surface detail all the time, but it doesn't mean I have a deep understanding of the statistics of random surfaces. It just means I know how to fool the eye

books||1.0||Oh.... my.... God!!!! There is another Patricia Kennealy running mad through the streets and shouting about high schoolish love fantasies that exist only in her mind. I thought one Patricia was enough. But after reading this book, I am faced with the frightening realization that there are TWO of them!Also, what I find very disturbing is that this version of Patricia may be even daffier than the original version. After reading just 6 or 7 pages of this hallucination horror show it was evident to me that the author is suffering from a case of Patriciaitis and a dose of Kennealyism.By the 40th page I was searching for my red slippers so I could click them together and get back to Kansas. Or anywhere else, as long as my copy of this book didn't make the trip with me. A pack of lies and a waste of paper and time. I would rather read Mary Poppins than wade through this endless journey of rubble.
books||1.0||My almost-6 year old daughter was diagnosed with autism at age 2 and we took a multi-pronged approach, including things like supplements, a GFCF diet, and OT/PT/speech. After a year on the GFCF diet and many specialized supplements and no change in behaviors, we went back to a normal diet with standard vitamin supplements and continued her behavioral therapies. Our close friends' daughter, now age 4 and also diagnosed with autism, took a similar approach, but even more strict, following the DAN protocol as well as the recommendations of this book, including chelation, a dizzying array of supplements, GFCF diet, OT/PT/Speech, ABA, etc. While our child has made tremenous advances, or friends' child has not, beyond minor advances related to her age--at 4, she is still non-verbal, far from potty trained, exhibits many repetitive behaviors, and needs constant verbal and visual cues for the simplest tasks. The point I am trying to make is that every child is different and no one, NO ONE has shown that one course of therapy cures or even convincingly improves a significant percentage of children with autism. Autism, as most of you likely know well, is a catch-all term. Our friends' daughter no doubt has a very different kind of pathology than ours. I have yet to really see a book or study address that fact first and foremost before offering a course of action, rather than immediately launching into predictions of one "cure" for a broad range of issues. While I do think some of what the author recommends can be helpful (and it really may offer a tremendous help for some children with autism), some of the therapies (like chelation) can be very dangerous--in fact, I have yet to see one of the many families who tried chelation therapy see *any* improvement in their child's symptoms. I have seen more success with GFCF diets (for a small percentage of children), but the greatest success seems to come with comprehensive behavioral therapy. I certainly understand where families are coming from--I have been there myself, but treating your child like a guinea pig and attempting to "cure" them with multiple substances that have had very little study/peer review in a desperate frenzy of worry is both dangerous to their bodies and destructive to their emotions. As with anything, balance is your approach will serve you and your child well.
books||2.0||Jesus, talk about the little girl crying "wolf." When I picked up this book, I expected to read a truly terrifying tale about how people got sick with a horrifying disease that no one knew/knows how to deal with. What I got instead was a lot of perseverating and a lot of emotional presumption. The book starts out promisingly, even if Preston surrenders freely to flowery prose. We're given the account of Charles Monet, one of the first documented cases of the Ebola virus. From there on, Preston gives a description of the virus, what it does, how it does it - the works. Then, he moves on to the Human Component, the cast of characters, so to speak, for the big story.The big story is, alas, not so impressive. It's a case of an Ebola outbreak amongst a shipment of monkeys that everyone thinks is going to cause awful problems to come about, but nothing of the sort happens. Basically, people run around in bio-hazard gear, fret a lot, and monkeys die. In between, Preston manages to surpass his self-indulgence to talk about other cases of the Ebola virus, cases of people being infected, "crashing and bleeding out," cases that are a lot more interesting than a shipment of monkeys, unless you're a PETA type.The worst thing about The Hot Zone is just how self-indulgent Preston is. He starts to novelize his subjects a few chapters into the book, which is a noble idea, but not when they don't die at the end. Basically, he's trying to make you care about these people, and all for naught. And by the time that you're supposed to be truly concerned, you actually WANT them to die, because you're tired of hearing about him describe, in active detail, what they eat in the morning, what they do in the afternoon, and how they lie in bed with their spouses at night. When you're addressing a subject as fascinating as a Level 4 virus, why are you spending time talking about Nancy Jaax's hands and karate prowess? Moreover, when you've finally gotten to the monkeys, why are you talking about what kind of monkeys they are and how they dwell in the wild? Does anyone really care?I wish I could say that this book moved me in ways other than to reverse my peristalsis, but I can't. Preston's ornate metaphors that pepper almost every page of this book are tiresome and unnecessary; he had the chance to write a compact little thriller about an averted crisis of global proportions, but he instead chose to "get into the minds" of his subjects. And what a bore that became. There were only two redeeming aspects of this book: one was the description of the African, human Ebola victims, and the other was the description of the virus itself, although, again, both were sabotaged by Preston's inability to write. If you want to know something about Ebola, go get An Idiot's Guide to Dangerous Diseases and Epidemics. If you're pining for the namby-pambiness of the Human Element, read The Hot Zone. Personally, I like to avoid rereading the Uncle Tom's Cabins of scientific accounting
books||5.0||Being a dyed-in-the-wool Mcguane fan, I think he just keeps getting better.  Not only is he the best fishing writer alive, but his non-fishing stories are bizzarely entertaining, have an interesting twist, and always explore human interaction. I believe his writing is based on his many and varied experiences, from crazy street people to ego-crazed CEOs, as well as the many places he has lived.  Who else would know what a cabinet is, except a Rhode Island resident?  What...no mention of hot weiners or coffee milk?

books||2.0||This is probably one of the hardest books I have ever read--with no background in either philosophy or cybernetics, much of what Hayles discusses is just plain incomprehensible.  I also found it difficult to accept the idea of humans already being "post-human."  If you are interested in deep philosophical writings on technology and the human condition, with links to literature, read this.  If you don't really care about the post-human, skip it
books||2.0||Ms. Reichs has lost the recipe, or at least the focus and formula that has brought her success prior to Cross Bones. Although not nearly as bad as P. Cornwell's last two or three misfires, Reichs is way wide of her usual high mark here. In this offering, Temperance is out of character, out of both style and focus, and the story is just overly convoluted and circuitous; a yarn that meanders around heading every which way except toward a finished product. Even the writing is unfamiliar and not of the same voice Reichs has maintained in her many Brennan novels. Having finally given up on Cornwell, after many years, I'll hang in there for one more Temperance Brennan dig; everyone is entitled to one gong
books||5.0||Having read Katherine, I wanted to get my hands on another Anya Seton novel. Her words are beautiful and her accurate historical references in the Medieval and Renaissance eras are breathtaking. People recommended Green Darkness because of its timeless romance, historical feel and paranormal aspects centered on past lives and reincarnation. So I gave Green Darkness a whirl. This enormous book (a big trade paperback with over six-hundred pages) enthralled me from beginning to end and I wish it had been longer, that the magic hadn't ended. Despite its rather large size and intricate story, the novel ended too soon for me. (I like big books, but you have to make sure that you will enjoy the whole thing when getting a large volume.) I finished this gem in three sittings. The novel's setting begins in the late 1960s (around the year this was first published). Richard Mardson takes his beloved wife, the American heiress Celia Taylor, to his estate in Sussex, England. There he shows her around the ancient castle that had belonged to his noble family for centuries and introduces her to his friends and peers, all respectable noblemen and women like Richard. But something strange begins to happen between them. Celia is experiencing deja vu, as though she'd been there before. This happens the second she enters the castle. At the same time, Richard becomes restless and moody. Celia is bewildered by his abrupt change from the once loving man to someone who isolates himself and avoids her. Their lives and their marriage could be in shambles, and Celia has to go back to her previous life during Tudor England to figure out what had gone wrong in order to salvage their happiness at present time. Her past life is a woman named Celia Bohun who falls for a handsome monk named Stephen (Richard) Mardson. Their forbidden love is timeless and the things they go through are staggering. There are many twists throughout the novel.I have read few novels that had made me go through as many emotions as this one had done. Celia and Stephen's love for one another was something truly beautiful and tragic at the same time. This novel brought me to tears by the time I finished. The building of tension between the protagonists is almost palpable. Celia is a very complex heroine. She is proud and innocent, but also could be quite the vixen when she sets her mind to it, especially when Stephen is involved. Stephen is a tall, dark and gorgeous hero who has taken a vow of chastity for his religion, but his attraction to Celia is undeniable and it is something that torments him. This part of his personality makes him a tortured soul and he is very appealing as a result. The part in which Celia looks after him when he falls ill is one of the sexiest scenes in the novel. It has a mixture of eroticism and innocence, for it is the first time Celia sees Stephen's nude body. The romance is indeed wonderful, but the historical references make this novel all the richer and more palatable. We experience all of the things that occurred during Tudor England, from Henry VIII's reign passing on to Queen Mary and onto Queen Elizabeth I. I have been reading quite a lot of historical/biographical novels and finding this book was like finding hidden treasure. You feel the time period and the events that took place in those times. The most insightful things for me were those centered on Queen Mary's persecution of Protestants and all the historical things that occur while time passes after the scandal centered on Celia's love for Stephen. The ending is one of the best endings I have read. Green Darkness is a true treasure that all historical enthusiasts should own. The story is quite intricate, not an easy read by a long shot (I find that most novels that center on reincarnation are very complex), but the overall development of the story is extremely well woven and beautifully executed. There are numerous characters in this novel, but I never felt like I had to keep up with them in order to remember them. Each character serves his or her purpose and I loved them (or hated them if they were villains). The one thing that puzzled me was the emphasis on Mabel's weight. I thought plump women were considered prettier in those times. And Celia (the twentieth century one) sounds a little too British for an American who'd set foot in England for the first time. Other than those negligible details, Green Darkness is perfect. Anya Seton was a great author, one of the best in her time. I think I like this novel more than Katherine. I wonder if Anya Seton and this novel inspired Jude Deveraux to write Remembrance (which I read at the same time as this one), which is another romance centered on soul mates and past lives partly set in the sixteenth century. Anyway, Green Darkness is one of the best historical/paranormal novels out there and I cannot recommend this memorable gem enough
books||5.0||A very straight forward book by Jim Otto. There is a price when one wants to achieve or aspire to achieve glory on the gridiron. Jim Otto is that person and he candidly tells us what he was willing to sacrifice to reach that plateau. For the Raider fan at heart, or a football fan in general, this is the book to read
books||2.0||I agree with another reviewer who said the book was unnecessarily long.  Genetic Algorithms are a great programming tool, and there are some tips and tricks that can help your programs converge faster and more accurately, but this book had a lot of redundant information.If you are interested in using GA for solution-finding, I doubt you'll find much useful in this book beyond the first chapter or so.  Many of the examples later in the book were so specific that I couldn't see how they could be usefully generalized.  Really optimizing a GA approach for a specific problem domain takes a fair amount of tuning, and this book won't help much with that.I think time spent surfing siteseer or other publication sites would be better spent than reading this book.
books||1.0||I wanted to be interested in this book, but it became pretty boring ater a while. There is an undercurrent of romanticism that pervades the authors purpose. He claims to be neutral, yet his descriptions and conversations with many of the people slant towards idol worship. Although the author claims to be in recovery, I did not get the sense of how drugs and alcohol can ruin peoples lives. I felt that his narrative was self serving, and glorifying the wonders of drugs and experimentation. There is a price to pay. What was good was hearing his father's take on the whole down side of watching his son grow up loaded. That was interesting. I'm getting weary of the proselytizing about how epochal the 1960's, 70's and 80's were. I didn't like his picture either

books||1.0||This book belongs in the Fantasy section of the library.Let's start with the question of Israel's borders.  Do some folks say that these borders ought to be the Nile and Euphrates rivers?  After all, Israel is kind of small.  Doesn't it need, um, a tiny bit more land?Well, Israel may need a little more land.  But almost nobody is proposing anything like this.  I see very few Israeli politicians demanding even all of the West Bank, let alone all of Jordan.  And as for the Nile to the Euphrates, this is pretty much exclusively anti-Zionist propaganda.  There's a nice article by Daniel Pipes in the March, 1994 issue of Middle East Quarterly that goes into this in some detail, in case anyone cares.Yes, we've seen propaganda before.  In the 1930s, some Germans claimed that the Jews were planning to take over the whole world.  Now, what do we see in this book?What we see in this book is Chris Hedges quoting someone as saying that Israel allows state-funded religious schools to preach that Jewish rule should extend from the Nile to the Euphrates.  Is there any connection between this and truth?Yes, there's a connection.  You see, in the Bible (in Deuteronomy), Moses says at one point that Israel's borders shall run from the river Euphrates to the "western sea" (presumably, the Mediterranean, but definitely not the Nile).  Of course, someone might want to ask a Jewish authority about what the Bible says.  It turns out that there's much more detailed material in the Book of Numbers, and that is what Pipes says religious Jews are taught is Biblical.  And that specifies a much smaller Israel.  In addition, it is quite a leap to go from Biblical borders, no matter how large or small, to preaching that Jews ought to rule such an area today.  Hedges is doing us a big disservice here.  You may want to check all this for yourselves.In addition, Hedges has an exciting description of the Battle of Khafji (which took place during Desert Storm).  Some people who were really there dispute it, however.  You may want to check that as well.We also see Hedges describe the behavior of Israeli soldiers in Gaza on June 17, 2001.  Now, remember that these soldiers are trained to obey orders.  Their superiors know that Israel can't afford unnecessary violence.  The soldiers are there to protect lives, not to hurt or kill others.  And in fact, it turns out to be true that in the fighting between Jews and Arabs, the Jews (as expected) have rarely been guilty of gratuitous violence.  On the other hand, the Arabs, who have rather different goals and constraints, have displayed quite a bit of bad behavior.Nevertheless, in spite of logic and facts to the contrary, in this book, Hedges comes up with the following (as usual, I encourage you to verify for yourselves what the truth is, and you might want to start by finding out how many people died that day and who they were):"I had seen children shot in other conflicts that I had covered - death squads gunned them down in El Salvador and Guatemala, mothers with infants were lined up and massacred in Algeria, and Serb snipers put children in their sights and watched them crumple onto the pavement in Sarajevo - but I had never watched soldiers entice children like mice into a trap and murder them for sport."Well!  What is it about Israelis that could lead them to behave in such a surprising manner?  Hedges speculates that exposure to all sorts of nasty reading material about the Holocaust has perverted these unfortunate young men.  Well, I'm perfectly prepared to believe that men and women from all nations have been exposed to all sorts of reading material.  But I don't buy Hedges' absurd conclusion at all.  Nor do I buy any of what he says about the behavior of the soldiers.  And no, I'm not in denial.  If you believe Hedges, I think you may be in denial, though!I'll stop here.  Anyone capable of saying what I've quoted from Hedges so far is capable of saying anything.  We readers do not need this.
books||5.0||As a recent grad of an org chem graduate program who had to suffer through the nearly 20 year old text "Mechanism and Theory in Organic Chemistry" by Lowry and Richardson, this book by Anslyn and Dougherty is a fabulous update that is easy to read and great asset to any chemistry student.  I agree with the other reviewers that the problem sets are challenging, the text is clearly written, and the material relates well back to current research issues. If you are a graduate student considering getting another reference to help you through your organic chemistry graduate program, get this book before you try "Advanced Organic Chemistry: Structure and Mechanisms" by Carey and Sundberg. I expect that "Modern Physcial Organic Chemistry" will become a staple to most chemist's shelves similar to that of a CRC Handbook or "Advanced Organic Chemistry" by March.

After all, she's my wife) I bothered to pick it up and read it.  How I wish I had listened to her and left it in the box of stuff for the rummage sale.  I cannot stand Baldacci's juvenile charactor dialog, but finish it I did though most of it I could have read through closed eyes and not missed anything.  I'll stick with my Nelson DeMille from here on if I want literary junk food

The playful bantering had me laughing uncontrollably and falling in love with the characters even more with every page I read. With all the other reviews, I don't need to explain the plot. It isn't anything new for the romantic suspense genre, but very entertaining and an enjoyable read. It has mystery, intrigue, suspense, action, and romance.

books||4.0||Many reviewers of this book have given it high marks because it is a terrific tutorial and that introduces most of the crucial techniques for writing great reports. I would agree as I have reporting experience with MS-Access and Crystal and this book helped me get up to speed quickly.  If you like learning in a step-by-step fashion right out of a book - this is the book!The bad reviews came from people that were looking for more of a reference type book.  While this book is not a bad reference it does fall short as a reference book.  For example,  one reviewer brought up that the ability to shade alternating detail rows of a report does not appear to be easy to find in this book.  I would agree with that. I was unable to go into the index and find a quick solution in this book. If you want a better reference book try the WROX book, Professional SQL Server 2005 Reporting Services.  That book is not as good as this book from a step-by-step standpoint but it is a better reference when you need a quick solutions.  For example, page 272 has code on how to shade alternating rows - they call it Greenbar Reports.  It was not easy to find in this book either.  How many people would look up "Greenbar Reports" in the reference?  I was looking into "shading alternative rows".  I just happened to stumble upon it.I bought both books together.  Of course there is lots of overlap but between the two that is all you will need to become a pro at Reporting Services.Reporting Services could use a COOKBOOK-style text like they have for Access and other programming languages. Those types of books have served me well over the years. Until then this book and the WROX book should do the trick
books||2.0||Throughout my read, my head kept shaking with disappointment.  If the "renaissance" of hard SF relies on stories a full decade, even two decades, old, then the genre's future is feebly fixated on its past.  Not to say that some of the stories here aren't wonderful ... emphasis on "some."  But dredging dead decades to claim a rebirth of hard SF fails to deliver on the title's promise.  This is more nostalgia than renewal, and you should read a library-borrowed copy if you want to reminisce about great writers past/passing.  But don't drop any real money expecting a glimpse into Sci-Fi's future
books||1.0||What a waste of time. This was like sitting through a very boring business course. I was never interested in turning the page. I would have liked to see more of Carly personal side and maybe some human aspect to this story.Instead I felt like a robot was telling this story.Very much of how great her business style was and very little about anything else. I forced myself to finish this. A huge diaappointment.Don't waste your money
books||2.0||I was interested in the plot and characters for about half the book.  After that it seemed that little new information was added, or the little that was new came in the midst of much repetition.  There were so many different characters, and we had to hear the separate reactions of each of them to bits of news.  The structure of the tale reminded me of the way a police procedural might be played out on TV
books||1.0||Sorry guys, I looked forward to working on recipes from this cookbook due to the very enthusiastic reception it received from the media.  The graphics of the book are truly beautiful.  The recipes however, hmmm,  try again.  I followed a simple recipe for Apple Crisp and got a bad result.  I now go to respected standard cookbooks for my Apple Crisp recipe and the old family favorite always turns out great.  Really people, the recipes are NOT the stuff of greatness.  Graphics? Great. Photography? Great?  Recipes? You have got to be kidding
books||2.0||I'm at page 116 right now.  The writing is lovely, the specifics dense, and the sense of place rich.  If the author tries to create suspense one more time by having the father say, "I just can't go on with this story!" I'm going to throw the book at the wall.  Also, so many embarrassing little holes.  If I were a librarian I would say, "So Dracula's checked out.  Go to a bookstore.  Every bookstore in the country has a copy."  And if I were the cat, I would know I was a goner the second I appeared as indeed he does within a paragraph(you need to plant the gun in an early scene if you're going to fire it).  Lastly, it seems like Dracula would be so much more efficient if he just killed the main characters rather than killing everyone around them.  Unless "Dracula" is related to our heroine--that would be good.  Will read a bit more. . .

books||2.0||I enjoyed Andy Kessler's book about finance (Wall St Meat) but this one is just silly.  It seems to show the wisdom of the old writer's saw about sticking with something you know about.  This book is like sitting in a bar listening to a drunken bore try to impress you with all the little bits and pieces he heard at a hospital that day.   I couldn't wait to get to the end so I could throw it out
books||1.0||I am pretty sure that the author sent the only positive review.  That is pretty pathetic.  This book was written with no rhyme or reason.  There is no good progression of information or understandable sense to it all.  One  star is stretch.  Plus, i am asian, and it was still hard for me-that is  when you know it is bad
books||1.0||I am having a hard time understanding why people have raved about this book.  I guess everyone is entitled to have loyal fans, but I just don't see what was great, or even good, about this story.Two teenagers enter a school and end up killing seven people.  They are caught, they confess, and the Grandmother of one of the killers hires Spenser to prove the boy's innocense.  We are given the impression a great mystery, with possible red herrings, is about to entertain us.  Alas, it is not to be.  The kids did it, plain and simple.  Why they did it is so stupid.  The story reads as though a sixth grader has written it.  The plot is lame, and even as lame as it is, it isn't executed well at all.The characters are boring and 2 dimensional.  The banter which takes place between the main character and others, while it seems to be trying to be witty, is just dumb and unbelievable.  I just can't say enough about how stupid this story is.  There are too many wonderful mystery authors out there writing gripping, intense works of fiction to waste your time on this one.  This is the first novel I have read by this author and will most definitely be my last

books||5.0||This book is the right choice for beginers and advanced users of Spring. It covers all major aspects supported by the framework, and goes beyond than a "24 hours learning" book. Emphasizes the basic theory and shows how to correctly use the framework in J2EE applications
books||2.0||The author had all the elements for a good mystery/suspense except for one thing, the lack of an end or resolution to the mystery.I find it difficult to believe the author of such noted works as Bag of Bones and The Stand would leave his readers hanging in such a manner. Fiction should be about conflict and resolution and we have the basis for the conflict. A body turns up on the beach and the only clue comes from a pack of cigarettes found on the body. We learn the man was from Colorado but very little else.If the author had brought the story to a meaning conclusion it might well have been a classic mystery or crime thriller but unfortunately the reader is left to wonder what really happened. I would recommend a Mary Higgins Clark mystery in place of this boo
books||5.0||National Geographic Magazine has long been recognized for the quality of its color photographs by its brilliant staff of photographers who manage to go to places both known and unknown and open vistas of other cultures, other peoples, other landscapes.  In this very large and exceptionally affordable volume are some of NG's finest images plus many dazzling photographs not previously published in the magazine. The result is a panorama of the world as few other books can supply.Covering nearly all the countries of the world, WIDE ANGLE uses its descriptor to unfold some remarkable images of fields and terrain and the peoples who inhabit them, all composed beautifully with NGs typical 'hidden camera' technique.  This is a travel volume for those who plan to visit the out of the ordinary places as  well as a scrapbook for those who have been to the more accessible places, but is it more: this is a closer look at the planet we inhabit that is so magnificent  it urges us by images alone to protect the beauty we threaten to destroy.

books||1.0||If you're going to write about the city that is Paris, you'd better be up to the task.  Gopnik may have the writing and observation skills that would have served this assignment well, but this collection of essays generally falls flat.  For someone who resided in the City of Light for 5 whole years, Gopnik gives us a surprisingly myopic picture constrained by his own self-absorption.  Those who are interested in Paris and its natives will be sorely disappointed in the smug chronicles of a New Yorker who regards himself and his son to be the most interesting elements of this city.  I have zero interest in My-Toddler-Does-Paris stories and Gopnik's relentless insertion of his look-how-cute-my-kid-is accounts should have been saved for a family re-union instead of wasting precious space that could have been used for more interesting topics.  For a better book on Paris cuisine and culture, check out the collection of Gourmet essays from the last 60 years titled 'Remembrance of Things Paris'.  It provides a wider variety of perspectives and a more expansive and interesting view of Paris -- and it's blessedly free of all that baby's-scrapbook stuff. 
books||1.0||I read this book and hated it; I was sorry I wasted my money.... Normally, I would have donated the book ater reading it. But, in this case I was so disappointed, I threw the book away after reading it.  I was disappointed with the author for scrubbing the language so clean that the area she set the book in could have been anywhere in the US.  I was also disapponted in the Oprah book club selection committee.  It seemed to me they found a "story" they liked, and that is where their critical thinking ended. It was the only and last Oprah book selection I ever bought.   After reading it, it was obvious to me that whoever had chosen the book for the Oprah club had never been to western Pa.  I am from western PA as is O'Dell and this book lacks local color.  She either forgot or choose to ignore that language is also a part of the landscape of a locale.  Landscape is just not about dysfunctional families, EatnParks and religious statues in the yards.... People in that area of PA say "ain't," "slippy," and "youns." This would be esp. true for someone like the main character, Harley. (There are people with college degrees from this area who still have "color" in their language.) O'dell is no Faulkner or Caufield. I find this lack of "local flavor" with a lot of modern authors.  Unfortunately, our books are even becoming Mcdonaldized. There is nothing special about this book

books||1.0||First off, so much of the copy is devoted to his horrible sense of humor, imagine a junior high school student "acting big" to impress his friends with jokes, that type of annoying bravura humor is simply unrelenting throughout the book.  It is filler.  The illustrations are sized so big the actual technical content of the book is quite low.  Just more filler.  Finally, all the techniques in the book can be found during normal operation of PS, or at worst a few internet searches.  I think this book is over-priced and I wish I could return it.  Caveat emptor
books||1.0||This is one of the few books so bad that I couldn't finish it.  There is no explanation of how things work,or in many cases what they really are.  I feel like the only motivation for any of the characters was greed, sex, or guilt about greed and sex.  Do not bother with this book

books||2.0||She wastes the first chapters, and my time, going to extremes with kooky consultants that only someone who doesn't deserve to be hired would use.  It adds to the drama and despair I suppose, but it comes off as contrived, and as an attempt to pander to her extremist/pessimist reading coterie.I don't think Babs could have possibly put more words in quotations.  Her OCD with quotated words and terms is a distraction that ultimately drove me nuts. I can't believe she's an accomplished writer.Her writing style can best be described as unsmooth and read-stoppage inducing.Oh well, her intentions were good

books||5.0||A Late Divorce is one of my very favorites novels.  This ordinary tale about the late divorce of a middle-aged couple, one of whom is in a mental institution, is told from the perspective of each member of the family:  children, their spouses and mates, grandson,etc.  I have rarely laughed so  much, or been touched so much, by the insightful description of the Kaminka  family and their travails over a failed marriage, real estate and conflict.   The scene with the rabbis at the mental institution is literary hilarity  at its best...A wonderful work, original, illuminating and FUNNY
books||5.0||John Lynch wrote a classic in Spanish-American Revolutions 1808-1826. He masterfully describes all the events that led to the independence of Latin America from Spain. The book starts in Rio de La Plata and ends in Mexico and Central America. Curiously one can note a common pattern of highly stratified societies lead by Spanish officials and merchants in not complete harmony with the Creole ruling class. The reluctance of Spanish Monarchy (and later even of liberals) led to independence basically motivated for the economic and social interests of the Creoles (Spanish born in America). For all of those who are interested in a better understanding of Latin American societies of today this great book is a must. Lynch cleverly combines historical and economic facts about the Hispanic American societies looking for free trade and in such a way clashing with the status quo of monopolies imposed by the decaying metropolis.  Two thumbs up
books||5.0||The new economy is a global economy favoring intangible things: ideas, information, and relationships and is intensely interlinked.   Today, the new information based sector occupies over 15% of the total US economy.  In the postindustrial society, communication has become the economy and the cultural, technological, and conceptual impacts reverberate at the roots of our lives.   The financial sector has reshaped the economy; the financial sector ownership involves only a small number of people;  the financial innovations include: mortgages, insurance, venture funding, stocks, checks, credit cards, and mutual funds; the financial sector has given rise to corporations, market capitalism, the industrial age, and has influenced how all business has been done.  Since communication is the economy, the net is the future.  The net has accelerated in usage due to the increase in silicon chips and fiber optic data transmission; the net is weaving lives, minds, and artifacts into a global scale network; the result is the swarm of information, reticulating the surface of the planet; the new economy will increasing obey the logic of the networks and understanding the network will be the key to understanding how the economy works.  In 1997, there were 6 billion non-computer chips and by 2005 the predicted usage was at 10 billion.The network represents connectivity.  We are connection everything to everything.  The network values the dumb power of bits in the swarm; the connectivity and usage of the dumb bits or parts in the swarm yield smart results; and we don't need advanced Artificial Intelligence to make an intelligent system.   The network is a link of distributed, bottom up, data bits;   it lets things communicate among themselves and takes a decentralized approach for communication, for example, manufacturing robots scheduling their own work based on incoming requests, as they bid on work dependant on their capability.  The swarm aim is superior performance in a turbulent environment.  Consider the power of the "Wisdom of the crowds".  In one case sample, 5,000 attendees, at a computer graphics conference were give individual access to a simulator and the task on how too land a plane.  The attendee had novice knowledge about how to land the plane.   The jet responded to the average decisions of the swarm.  The group landed the jet with almost no direction.   In another case example, the group was given the task to navigate a submarine and go look for buried treasure.   The group could not initiate any movement until leadership from a loud speaker was given to "go right".  The leadership unlocked the paralysis of the swarm and the direction facilitated action.Technology success is measured on how invisible it becomes to the end user and how effective it becomes to the long term strategy in developing products and services that can't be ignored.   The power of the network increases in value n power 2 where n is the number of members.  Therefore, networks need to increase their critical mass of members to become effective.   Innovation attracts members.  Innovation is more important than price; price is the derivative of innovation; monopolies push up price and decrease quality and create a dangerous singular source of innovation; and the network destroys monopolies through collective innovation, such as, open source.
books||4.0||The Pelican Brief is one of John Grisham's more fast paced and exciting book. Two supreme court justices are murdered by someone who does such a good job that there are few if any clues to go on. Darby Shaw and her lover/professor are intrigued by who could have done this so Darby does a ton of research and writes the "Pelican Brief". Her boyfriend/professor is a good friend of someone in the FBI and the file gets distributed. The bad guys find out about Darby, who apparently has hit the suspects right on and the chase begins. This book is very entertaining with nonstop action. You'll be constantly turning the page to see how Darby and friends etc keep escaping and how the plot will unfold. The only problems with the book are as follows: 1 - The book has so many characters that it gets confusing at times2 - The book is all action and adventure and little else. Once it's done you'll never go back and read it again. This would make a very poor book club book.3 - A little over the top on the implied sex etc between Darby and her professor etc... (but nothing compared to what you'll get in other books)Overall a very entertaing and exciting book but not a lot of "soul". I would definitely recomend it to anyone who likes action books. 
books||4.0||Since I am a World's Fair "fanatic" I have read almost everything that I can on the subject. In general, this is an interesting and well researched book. The author has apparently attended most of the expositions that he writes about. However, I must point up three rather glaring errors in the book. In describing the Louisiana World Expo of 1984 he states that the unbuilt symbol tower was supposed to be "80 feet tall,just 150 feet shorter than the Eiffel Tower." Since the Eiffel Tower is actually over 900 feet tall,the New Orleans fair tower would have had to have been at least 800 feet tall.This may have been a typo which the author did not catch in time.The other error states that the US Pavilion at the Brussels World's Fair of 1958 was a "large,squat,round concrete block structure." It was indeed large and round, but not squat and not made of concrete blocks.According to the excellent book about Edward Durrell Stone, the architect of the pavilion,the outer walls consisted of large aluminum panels which were latticed in intricate designs so that the interior would be flooded with natural light. I have seen photos of the US Pavilion, and it seems a beautiful and airy structure to me. (In comparison to the Soviet Pavilion, which resembled a large refrigerator!) Thirdly, the Spokane Expo of 1974 was not the first time that the U.S.S.R. exhibited at a U.S. expo. They had a large pavilion at the New York World's Fair of 1939. All in all, however, I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the history of World's Fairs
books||2.0||I am a teacher at an inner-city school that struggles with the same issues presented by Kozol.  That said, this is the fourth of Kozol's works that I have read, and I came away just as disappointed with "The Shame of the Nation" as I did with the rest of them.  I am so incredibly sick of him shouting from the mountaintops that there is a problem with public education.  He acts like we don't already know.  He acts like there is some unseen solution out there that should be obvious to everybody.  Instead of pointing fingers and and complaining about it, why doesn't he use his experience and know-it-all knowledge to offer real, concrete and practical solutions?  Kozol is a classic Monday-morning quarterback pointing out the flaws in what everybody else is doing - but he doesn't get his hands dirty anymore.  If he is really as educationally omnipresent as he thinks he is, the least he could do is offer some solutions.  I've made four mistakes.  I will not make a fifth.  I have 150 underpriveleged kids to teach, and I can't afford to waste my time on another volume of complaints while he points out the obvious

He holds on to it for dear life and swears, had he read this years ago, it would have changed his life for the better and he wouldn't be where he's at.  He raved so much, he insisted I order one for myself.  I did.  In summary, what I derived from the reading was one must be callous in this life and put yourself first.  Otherwise, you'll be no more than a stepping stone for others.  It's a good book but I oftentimes got lost in all its references to those that preceded us by 500-600 years.  Fellow inmates that have the book feel the same as my son.  It's a Bible to them and they refuse to part with it for others to read for fear it will never be returned to them

books||2.0||From the remarks at this site, people either love this novel or hate it. I hated it. I hated it for the reason that it represents all that is bad about MFA program writing in the last 30 years. The emphasis is entirely on STYLE. Forget story. Forget that your reader needs some reason to be reading the narrative. Just throw out and string together wonderful language and the reader will follow you anywhere. Some of this thinking goes back to Henry James, some of it goes back to Virginia Woolf who was so terrified of books with plots or dominating conceits (like H.G. Wells' THE TIME MACHINE). The first 100 pages of this novel are about a real estate deal and the people to whom Frank Bascombe is trying to sell a property. It's brilliantly written. In fact, it's so brilliantly written that I had a lot of problems seeing a former sportswriter being so introspective and articulate about his life, his loves, and the region of the country he inhabits. This book has no driving plot. In fact, it's an arbitrarily chosen conceit: what happens on July 4th in the life of one guy. It's not James Joyce's ULYSSES nor is it trying to be, but EVERY thought this man has is in this book. And none of it is related to a plot or story or any reason whatever why a person--any perso--should pick up the book. Indeed, that seems to be the crux. I read this book because it was by Richard Ford, a man whom all of my colleagues in the mainstream fiction world revere. You must read this book, they said. So I did. And I consider it an extraordinary waste of my time. To be sure, this is a judgment call, but I'm allowed to make it. EVERY reader is allowed to make that call. But I know I'm in the minority in this. This book is supposed to be one of the greatest American novels of the last 25 years. But will it be so in another 25 years? Are novels now only to be interior monologues (which Virginia Woolf preferred and said so in her essay "Modern Fiction")? Perhaps our values are changing. Perhaps the MFA programs in this country are correct in only cultivating style rather than story. But what it eventually evolves into is a form of narcissism, wherein the author writes at length, putting on the page all of his or her thoughts about whatever and we're supposed to . . . what? Applaud it? I believe that the authors we'll remember will be the natural storytellers. I don't think Richard Ford is one of them. But, man, he sure can write
books||4.0||Oz talks sense. From the first chaper, I was hooked. She suggested making a minor change for the first week. I cut back on one soft drink per day - from 3 down to 2. That was quite painless. I also took her starter tips - drink water before meals and don't eat closer than 2 hours before bedtime. Again, those were minor and didn't crimp my style.This is not really a diet book though it deals with diet (as in what you eat). It's really about living well and making mostly good choices but not going overboard (and ultimately failing). Oz is a vegetarian, but she said that red meat was fine in moderation. Go for only twice per week on that she suggested. I love beef, but I also like chicken and fish and can tweak that part of my meal plan. Chips are junk food, but a bowl isn't a huge deal. Just don't grab the bag and keep munching. If you have an urge for chocolate, melt some semi-sweet chocolate and dip fruits like strawberries in the chocolate. It really does satisfy that chocolate craving with smaller amounts of chocolate.That's typical of her advice and things that I can handle and maintain.She also talks about exercise and about supplements (meant to supplement and not take the place of good food). She's reasonable with her ideas here as well. I added some extra work out time (even jogging 5 minutes while watching TV adds up if you do it pretty often) and bought a basic vitamin plus B, C and E (all heartily approved by my doc). Oz lost 10 pounds her first semester. This is not a crash course. She's down 30 lbs now (over 2 years I think) - just slowly and surely. And, she's maintained rather than yo-yo'ing.I think most people (college or not) would benefit from reading this book and trying out Oz's common sense plan. Older readers might need a little less food overall and might not opt to go out and have a snowball fight to burn calories, but the basics are here for a good lifestyle plan that isn't painful and does work.This would be a great book for anyone (females more so) headed off to college or in college. Oz has dealt with being overweight. She did a lot of research and put a workable plan into action. I think most readers will love her style and also will be able to use her ideas and stay slimmer and healthier.   
books||5.0||I fail to understand the complaints of two previous reviewers. This beautiful glossy volume is an excellent compendium of previosly publisned Cook's Illustrated  recipes. In style and format it would make an excellent first choice for anyone wishing to be introduced to a selection of the best of the best recipes from America's Teet Kitchen (i. e. Cook's Illustrated) without the tediousness of having to wade through lengthy descriptions of how the recipes were arrived at.The cooks at America's Test Kitchen test each recipe up to fifty! times, often in several versions before arriving at the what they (and their taste testers) feel is the very best recipe. No other cookbooks offer this degree of security to the home cook.Chapters include: Starters and Salads, Soups and Stews, Vegetables and Side Dishes, Eggs and Breads, Pasta, Meat, Poultry, Seafood, and Desserts. Throughout, are guides and charts to everything from grains to the best bakeware (also kitchen tested). The recipes range from familiar comfort food (e. g. Buttermilk Mashed Potatoes, Glazed Meatloaf, and Deep-dish Apple Pie) to "show-off" company fare (e.g. Baked Brie en Croute, Grill-roasted Chinese Style Duck, and Dark Chocolate Mousse). If your looking for recipes that work everytime, do yourself a favor and purchase any Cook's Illustrated cookbook, including this one. You won't be dissappointed. 
books||1.0||"OF PARADISE AND POWER" - BY ROBERT KAGAN"Americans are from Mars and Europeans are from Venus" - apart from simply raising a few eyebrows, this line by Robert Kagan author of "Of Paradise And Power", has not only caught the attention of many but managed to stir up a wave of discussions among the politicians and elites concerned with cross-Atlantic relations. Kagan's thought provoking book became extremely popular and received international acclaim for its analysis of the deteriorating US-Europe relationship, not to mention its catchy and striking phrases systematically introduced throughout the slender yet captivating book. Kagan introduces multiple chapters in his book, in order to deconstruct the key underlying issues which he claims are causes of the ever widening divide between US and Europe. In the chapter "The Power Gap", Kagan starts from World War I to understand the aversiveness Europe displays towards military and wars. He argues that while both the World Wars weakened Europe tremendously; they helped the US emerge as a super power. He further elaborates on the might of the US in the chapter that follows - "Psychologies of Power and Weakness". Kagan explains how lack of power can not only affect psychologies and ideologies, but change perspectives as well. He claims Europe's paucity of military power compels it to not only tolerate threats but ignore them all together and at the same time try and counterbalance the US force by constructing a world which is governed by economic and soft non-violent methods. This chapter culminates into "Hyperpussiance", a chapter in which Kagan discusses intricate details of Kosovo and Bosnia, highlighting Europe's failure and America's effectiveness in handling the situation. He finally presents his central argument in the chapters "The Post Modern Paradise" and "The World America Made" where Kagan states, "Europe's evolution into its present state occurred under the mantle of the U.S. security guarantee and could not have occurred without it." Casting doubts on Europe's intentions, Kagan centers his argument on the growing self-centered policies of Europe and questions the validity of cohesive terms such as `west' in his chapter "Is It Still `The West'"? Finally, it seems Kagan provides a solution to this insolvable problem of the US-Europe divide in his concluding chapter, "Adjusting to Hegemony", by simply stating one line - "the task for both Europeans and Americans is to readjust to the new reality of American hegemony". This extremely small book, as compared to the issue it addresses needs further analysis and some close examining. There are many issues to be addressed in Kagan's brief analysis and one might not be completely satisfied with certain claims, reasonings or the manner in which such a grave and sensitive topic is handled. While there is a tone of underlying bias (in contrast to the general opinion of a well-balanced view that the author holds), Kagan manages to miss out some crucial facts and figures, not to mention present stark paradoxes, and the essay lacks sufficient citings.      To start with, let me point out the contradictions in Kagan's arguments, the presence of which highly undermines his claims, leaving the reader in a dilemma unconvinced of either argument. Kagan claims, "Europe's relative weakness has understandably produced a powerful European interest in building a world where military strength and hard power matter less than economic and soft power...rules of behavior" (pg.37). He goes on to say, - "Since Europeans lack the capacity to undertake unilateral military actions, either individually or collectively as `Europe,' it is natural that they should oppose allowing others to do that they cannot do themselves."(pg.38) in contrast to "...Europe today has the wealth and technological capability to make itself more of a world power in military terms if Europe wanted to become that kind of world power" (pg.53-54). Kagan contradicts his own views, stating many times that Europe is militarily weak, nor does it have the capacity to build up its forces yet at the same time, puts forth an argument of Europe's capabilities of increasing its defense spending and military might to match the US.     In the chapter, Psychologies of Power and Weakness, Kagan's one claim contradicts another which is made in the next chapter as the reasoning for both his claims seem to be absolutely tangential. He first explains Europe's greater tolerance for threats is due to its weakness and the fearful past, which it has suffered from. He then metaphorically explains it by giving the example of a man with a knife and the same one with a rifle having different interpretations of the word `threat' when confronting a bear (pg.31). But again Kagan himself feels Europe can become a military power as and when it wishes to, when he says "They could easily spend twice as much as they are currently spending on defense if they believed it necessary to do so" (pg.54). So this forces me to ask a question, would one be mauled by a bear if one could produce a rifle to prevent this misfortune? So isn't it quite possible that Europeans feel safe, not because they "...enjoy the `free ride' they have gotten under the American security umbrella over the past six decades" (pg.54), but rather because there was and is no real threat at all?    With the use of phrases such as "The Axis of Evil" and "Rouge States" (pg.30), which Kagan uses to describe Iraq and Iran, not to mention his references to `Weapons of Mass Destruction' (which he uses as a pretext to the war in Iraq), which still seem to be elusive for some reason, he seems to perplex me by blatantly ignoring his own creation. While Kagan maintains that Iraq was a threat and the US perceived it as one while Europe did not, he might want to explain as to why, in 1997, he (Kagan was the Director of the Project for the New American Century) signed a document which justifies American occupation of the Middle-East, irrespective of threats from Iraq or Iran. "The United States has for decades sought to play a more permanent role in Gulf regional security. While the unresolved conflict with Iraq provides the immediate justification, the need for a substantial American force presence in the Gulf transcends the issue of the regime of Saddam Hussein...From an American perspective, the value of such bases would endure even should Saddam pass from the scene. Over the long term, Iran may well prove as large a threat to U.S. interests in the Gulf as Iraq has. And even should U.S.-Iranian relations improve; retaining forward-based forces in the region would still be an essential element in U.S. security strategy given the longstanding American interests in the region."(pg.17 - Rebuilding America's Defenses - *1) This forces me to conclude that either the author has resorted to `cherry picking' of evidence or he suffers from selective amnesia.    Some of his reasoning, analysis and analogies seem to be too nave. When explaining military action, one cannot justify it by saying, "When you have a hammer, all problems start to look like nails". The author speaks about the nation's (US's) willingness to go to war simply because it has the ability and the capacity to do so. Without discussing a need or providing concrete reasons for the use of aggression, the author seems to be content in justifying use of force, simply because one has it. One important aspect Kagan leaves out in his analysis are the political and economical aspects of the ongoing US-Europe feud. While I have discussed some economical aspects later in the review, one must note that Kagan does not mention the Kyoto Protocol (apart from Clinton's negotiation of it (pg.45)). The US withdrawal from the Protocol had created serious problems and divisions between the two giants (www.climnet.org - *2). While there were many other issues that further fanned the growing fire, disagreements over the Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty for example, which Kagan conveniently sweeps under the carpet, needed to be addressed if one is discussing transatlantic relations (www.bbcnews.com - *3, 4)    For a book which covers issues from the pre World War II decade (occasionally going back to ancient philosophy) to the present issues, 72 citations, from which many are simply extended explanations (for examples, see supra notes- 19, 20, 22), seem to be alarmingly low, especially with the absence of some important ones and not to mention, certain citations which wrongly allude to historical facts. Kagan mentions, "As `some' Europeans put it, the real division of labor consisted of the United States making the dinner and the Europeans doing the dishes" (pg.23), yet he does not refer to any source for this cynical statement. He says, "The vast majority of Europeans always believed that the threat (if any) posed by Saddam was more tolerable than the risk of removing him" along with other alleging statements like, "The rehabilitation and reintegration of Saddam Hussein's Iraq is precisely what they(Europe) sought" (pg.44) , and again gives no source for the origin of these beliefs. Strangely, he supports one of his claims by stating in his supra note.20, pg.30, "for that matter, this is also the view commonly found in American textbooks". One might not generally expect to see such puerile purporting evidence in a scholarly analysis of transatlantic relations. Kagan at times jumps back to Athenian times and has injected strong philosophies in his essay. He mentions a number of times how Americans see the world from a Hobbesian perspective while Europeans are followers of Kantinian policies. Kagan seems to have overlooked the fact, that though Hobbes had described the state of nature as that of "all against all", the only reason Hobbes justifies a sovereignty is to ensure peace on earth. Kagan conveniently cites Hobbes (Hobbes theory itself was flawed as later philosophers termed it as `Hobbes Dilemma') to justify American aggression, but no where in Hobbes' theory is aggression justified by the sovereign (Leviathan - Ch.17).     There are some conclusions Kagan draws which seem to be beliefs of an American idealist living in a world where politics is as pure as religion. He concludes that while the US was providing "free security" to Europe after the Cold War, "...America's great power and willingness to assume responsibility for protecting other nations..." (pg.34) has given Europe the opportunity to build up economically. Kagan further asserts his point when he says, "Given America's willingness to spend so much money protecting them, Europeans would rather spend their own money on social welfare programs, long vacations and shorter workweeks" (pg.54). These are inaccurate presentations of facts, which are more of subjective, bias ideologies. I would like to put forth two points in order to accentuate the conspicuous fallacy of these two statements. First, America's interest in Europe was not to provide it with security whether before or after the Cold War. One must not confuse the fact that measures taken to restrict the Soviet advance was purely for selfish motives, rather than for the benefit of nations which were under the watchful eye of the communist empire (Kagan himself acknowledges the fact when he says, "With the check of the Soviet power removed, the United States was free to intervene practically whenever and wherever it chose..."(pg26)). Second, when Kagan acknowledges that Europe which has a "$9 trillion " economy is in a comfortable position to support its welfare programs along with increased military spending; attributing the fact that Europe spends more on welfare, as he calls them "free-riders", results in a faulty analysis.When I had mentioned earlier that Kagan chose to omit and ignore certain facts, the example of the Balkans, which the author has cited many times in his book would seem most relevant. Kosovo is one of the primary issues he discusses to bring forth US benevolence and European incapacity. "American involvement in Kosovo or Bosnia was not based on calculations of a narrow American `national interest'...While Americans had a compelling moral interest in stopping genocide and ethnic cleansing,... the US had no `national interest' at stake in the Balkans"(pg.50), this is how Kagan sees it. Indeed stopping genocide was a concern, but was it the only concern? While Milosevic had very much agreed to station NATO troops in Kosovo to stop the conflicts, none seem to have been interested in his offer; they rather wanted complete access and control to all of Yugoslavia. The Rambouillet Accord, to which the Contact Group added an Appendix B on the last day of the conference held at Paris, one must note was the primary reason for rejecting NATO troops, as it demanded Yugoslavia to surrender its autonomy and sovereignty. Yet, he does not mention of Milosevic agreeing to station NATO troops in Kosovo (http://wsws.org *5).     Some thing missing from Kagan's entire book are the words "Latin America" and "Africa". As seen above, Kagan believes America was spending its money protecting Europe and Europe alone from all the threats around the world, before and after the Cold War. But what baffles me to quite an extent is that not once does Kagan mention about any American intervention in Latin America (official or not), Africa or the Far East for that matter. Those who are well aware of the world around them, will be aware of America's support for dictators and other corrupt regimes throughout Latin America and the far East, Indonesia for example, which were for self serving purposes alone or is it that the author is implying that the Latin American and African countries were a threat to Europe, hence the interventions and no mention of them? (A complete timeline by Steven Kangas can be found on multiple sites *6, 7, 8)     There is one severe `defect', as I put it, which undermines the entire argument of this book. Kagan's tunneled vision approach, which refers to the word `power' only in terms of military strength and capabilities, ultimately results in a false dichotomy, which is the stumbling stone for his thesis. Kagan believes the world and in particular, Europe, is left with two options, that either they follow the US or be a tacit audience. The reason he reaches this conclusion as I previously put it, is due to his convergent view. "Rather than viewing the US as a Gulliver tied down by Lilliputian threads", says Kagan, "American leaders should realize that they are hardly constrained at all, that Europe is not really capable of constraining the US". He reinforces this claim throughout his book (see pg- 33, 37-40, 59, 62, etc). The author's abysmal ignorance about hard-hitting, highly valid and relevant facts has rendered severe blows to the validity of his claims. Kagan has committed serious errors here, by ignoring Europe's strength, not military but political and economical indeed. With a population of 456,953,258 (the CIA Fact Book *9) and still growing, the EU, leave aside Europe, cannot be simply overlooked or brushed aside as a dead competitor or a bygone culture. Europe is economically strong enough to trouble the US as and when it wants to, the recent problems over the genetically altered meat, banana dispute, steel industry debacle, Airbus-Boeing clash and many more, have all proved that Europe's economic strength is much of a concern for the US.  While I must point out a rank deletion, I believe this is `the' single factor which is capable for arguing against all of Kagan's thesis and arguments, and that is the American Economy. Not once has he mentioned the deteriorating state of American economy (2001), even though problems did exist when he wrote this book. He seems to be blissfully ignorant and persists that America can sustain its exorbitant defense spending, "...the US can sustain its current military spending levels and its current global dominance far into the future". Strangely, the growing inflation rate, rising unemployment, stagflation, trends the economy was showing of heading towards a recession, were I believe dismissed as myths by the author (for statistics see - www.bbcnews.com; http://wsws.org *10, 11). Also, Kagan's final solution suggest that, "The obvious answer is that Europe should.... and build up its military, even if only marginally", leaves me with a conundrum. Is Kagan implicating that Europe has no military at all or is it that he wants to begin a new arms race, this time Cold War II? Kagan must understand he is writing this book for international publics and not simply those, whose ideologies are in tandem with his. Hence, I doubt most would disagree that the world should get into an arms race here, as we all know, there is no stopping to this evil if it once starts.While I have already discussed the effects of trade and economics (which Kagan ignores) on the US-Europe relation, there is something I must point out before I end this review. Kagan, rather conveniently digresses of the topic, which is transatlantic relationships, to justifying US hegemony in a neo-conservative fashion. While most Americans themselves would probably not agree with Kagan's ideology (as the public opinion and faith plummets - see polls from various news sources *12), leave aside Europeans or rest of the world, Kagan writes almost 15 pages to justify it. This was a rather disappointing conclusion to his book, where he thinks the only solution to the ever widening divide is "Adjusting to Hegemony". When Kagan says how many (statistics seem to abandon him) Americans believe that by advancing their interest, they advance the interest of humanity, he sounds exuberantly jingoistic and to drive the point home, he quotes Benjamin Franklin as saying - "America's cause is the cause of all mankind" and again I must bring to the author's notice, the recipient of these remarks is an international audience, which is diverse, has its own culture and heritage, religious beliefs and ideologies and has no reason to believe why their culture or beliefs are inferior to any other.  An author of his stature must realize that it is transatlantic relationships and not a primary grade bully that is being discussed. While he seems to take pride in saying that America has a "go it alone" attitude (pg.39, 99), it does not abide by the UN Security Council (pg.40, 99), takes action unilaterally irrespective of international laws (pg.45, 61, 99), is justified in adopting `double standards' (pg.62, 99), he fails to fathom the gravity of the current day (or rather the day when he wrote this book) situation and the growing unpopularity of American foreign policy around the world. While he sees Europe as an obstacle in the path of America's imperialistic goals, a neutral observer would be more than justified in pointing out that may be it is the US that hinders progress and efforts of the EU to establish a world which respects international laws, human rights, collective public opinion and most of all - peace. He fails to give an impartial, if not a complete solution to rid the world of this wedge as he weakly concludes his essay by saying, "...a little common understanding can still go a long way". While many have nothing but words of praise, as a one line summary by Francis Fukuyama calls it - "Brilliant" (a co-architect and signatory of the Rebuilding America's Defense Project) and according to Dr. Henry Kissinger, [against whom innumerable charges of human right violations have been levied, who ironically, Kagan terms as a "quintessential realist". See - http://en.wikipedia.org(for cases) *13; http://www.thenation.com(for list of crimes) *14] the book is a "seminal treatise" which would "shape the (US-Europe relation) discussion for years to come"; I do not particularly endorse it it. As I have already put forth immense supportive data to show why the book lacks a concrete argument, sane reasoning or supportive evidence, though its lucid prose, easy comprehension and its articulate linking makes it a good read, it barely digs deep into the problem or the solution, apart from scratching the surface, `the military surface'. Indeed the book did create waves in the political arena, which was probably due to its impeccable timing, but I cast serious doubts on the claims that it would be "discussed for years to come". *1   - http://www.newamericancentury.org/RebuildingAmericasDefenses.pdf*2   - http://www.climnet.org/news/march2001.html*3   - http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1383385.stm*4   - http://212.58.226.30/1/hi/business/2052405.stm*5   - http://www.wsws.org/articles/1999/apr1999/yugo-a14.shtml*6   - http://www.atrocities.net/ *7   - home.att.net/~Resurgence/CIAtimeline.html *8   - www.serendipity.li/cia/cia_time.htm	*9   - http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/ee.html*10 - http://www.wsws.org/articles/2000/dec2000/us-d30.shtml*11 - http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/1263211.stm*12 - http://www.michaelmoore.com/words/index.php*13 - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Kissinger*14 - http://www.thenation.com/blogs/capitalgames?bid=3&pid=17
books||4.0||"GPU Gems 2" edited by Matt Pharr (Addison-Wesley, 2005, ISBN 0-321-33559-7) is a collection of forty-eight white papers that detail cutting edge techniques based on today's latest graphical processing units (GPU).  The full color hardcover text is 784 pages and includes a CD-ROM with working demos and source for some of the articles presented in the book.  The text retails for $59.99.The book is divided into six parts: geometric complexity, shading, high-quality rendering, general purpose computation on the GPU, image oriented computing, and numerical algorithms.  A part has anywhere from five to twelve chapters.  Each chapter is written by a different author but the format and style is consistent.  The chapters have an introduction, discussion of the problem or technique, conclusion, and references.  The material is presented with color illustrations and occasionally some pseudo-code or code fragments.  Generally, the material is extremely current and very approachable to read.As a sequel to its well received predecessor, the text focuses on taking advantage of the computational power and features of today's high-powered GPU boards.  The first part of the book, geometric complexity, emphasizes this with chapters dedicated to batch rendering, using multi-streaming, hardware occlusion, and displacement pixel-shaders.  Each chapter illustrates how operations traditionally performed on the CPU can be moved into the GPU for efficiency and greater effect.The subsequent two parts on shading and rendering continue along the same theme: improved performance by using hardware functionality found on the GPU.  Each topic considers the performance ramifications and GPU capabilities when discussing the problem domain of a rendering technique and factors it into the final solution.  For example, chapter 10 considers irradiance environment maps for fast lighting - but with a twist - using the GPU to do the calculations in real-time.  In doing so, the book's real value becomes apparent.The fourth part on general purpose GPU computation is an interesting addition to the text.  The chapters illustrate methods of offloading traditional CPU tasks by exploiting the inherent parallel nature of modern GPU hardware.  Since the book features Nvidia hardware, the architecture and performance capabilities largely focused on their products.  In the fifth part of the book, hardware assisted image creation and analysis is considered.  By using context clues from the spatial, texture, or lighting data - additional refinements can be made to a scene prior to rasterization.  The topics presented in this part are further refinements of the text's main theme (using the GPU fully) and are specific solutions to uncommon problems - or approaches to rasterization.  None the less as GPUs continue to evolve, the topics presented in this section will undoubtedly become more common.Finally, the sixth part of the book provides several non-traditional graphics examples to illustrate calculating data on the GPU: solving linear equations, options pricing, and numerical simulation - just to name a few. As using the raw floating point power of modern GPU is a growing trend - these sections were quite interesting and well done.The included CD-ROM contains examples to 28 of the 48 articles in the book.  In most cases, the example material includes source code as well as pre-compiled binaries to help illustrate the topic presented in the text.   In order to run the majority of the samples, Cg must be installed on the host computer.  In addition, the CD-ROM provides access to Nvidia's software development kit, Cg toolkit, performance tools, and several helpful reference links to on-line sites.GPU Gems 2 provides a cutting edge view of the capabilities found in today's video cards.  The selected articles illustrate that every part of the rendering process can be enhanced in some fashion by fully using the underlying hardware.  As such, this book is essential to anyone working with modern GPUs.

books||4.0||Any beginner or intermediate learner, who wants to be enlightened on the basic mechanisms of both computer and its peripheral devices, would be laying a good foundation by starting with this book. Without compromising its concise outlook, the coverage of this book is as comprehensive as it is illustrative. Its updated chapters are well-appreciated, although that anyone who currently owns the seventh or even the sixth edition would not be missing much by sticking with either editions.Despite being labelled "How Computers Work", the contents of this book are not limited to PCs. They covered other related issues like: Networking, Multimedia, Printers, Software, and so on. Detailed explanations, which are frequently complemented by high-resolution graphics are abundant. This book literally takes its reader into the 'engine room' that keeps a computer running. It is an impressive virtual tour on paper!However, if you are an advanced learner, this book will be of little use to you. In fact, there is hardly anything in it that any self-respecting advanced learner has not come across. Likewise, Apple/Mac stalwarts need not invest in it. Its focus is entirely on the PC: with no room for Mac.All-in-all, the uniqueness of this book is plausible. It is a welcomed advantage. Every PC component, as well as peripherals, are laid bare. It is a resourceful hand-holding tools for beginners: a worthy and dependable guide for any novice

books||1.0||Communism is one of the most evil ideologies in human history, responsible for the extermination of 100+ million people. This book (which started it all) holds at least much of the blame. Communists were and still are a threat to the free world, and communism is a slave system. Some "intellectuals" actually support the tired mantras of Marx's philosophy, whether because they are insincere or simply pedants who haven't seen enough sunlight, I don't know. In any case, if they ever step foot in the real world they would take note that communism denies private property, and is totalitarian and slave-driving (the government owns everything, including you). And the deaths caused by communism are hardly necessary to bring up. Pol Pot, Mao, Stalin (of course), etc etc...who are these people kidding

books||2.0||I zipped through the first 100 pages of this book unable to put it down.  Unfortuneately the author seems to run out of gas after that.  The main character just goes on a big, boring sight seeing tour.  It reminded me of that show on the Travel Channel where that girl visits hotel after hotel fawning over the interior design. There is not a hint of conflict until the final pages and then it's very short-lived and quickly followed by one of the worst non endings I've ever read.  The book just stops.  Not a hint of resolution or even a cliff hanger pointing to a sequel.It's a shame because Grimsley had some great concepts to work with.  In my experience novels that mix technology with magic usually fail at both, but Grimsley had a workable foundation he could have developed into something unique if he had focused on the SF concepts instead of minutiae.  Once in a while the characters stop admiring the drapes long enough to notice the GIANT FREAKIN' PORTAL BETWEEN TWO WORLDS--but enough about that.  Gee, what a lovely sofa..

books||4.0||I am a Lutheran church librarian and I am glad I bought this very satisfactory book for our church library.  Its text stresses that children are the same the world over.  They have the same feelings and needs, and have the same hopes and dreams.  The illustrations are a nice change from the usual.  Each page is surrounded by a gold picture frame in which faux jewels are embedded.  The illustrations appear to be tempera or opaque watercolor, drawn in Persian style.  The colors are very saturated.  The book's cover gives you an idea of what they look like.  The message of this book is one of diversity--that even though children live in different parts of the world and may have different nationalities, races, ethnicities, languages or faiths, they still have the same hopes, dreams and daily needs.  This is a very important message for children to hear in today's world where there is so much suspicion of those we "perceive" to be different.  The more children realize that kids are the same everywhere, the more tolerant they will be.  Children pick up prejudice by the time they are three years of age, say researchers, so you have to nip it in the bud very early, and this book does that in a wonderful way. 
books||2.0||This book is the typical package of business ideas.  The book gets 2 stars because the few pages devoted to entrepreneurship has very little substance and the information under each idea is sparse and in many cases not helpful.  In addition, there are numerous ideas that require a tremendous amount of work.  The author does state that what may be work for one person, may be play to another.  However, this relates to doing something you enjoy or having a passion where you don't mind putting in the time or work.  The title suggests that the business ideas listed in the book will not require a great deal of time or effort, which is not the case for many of the ideas(Masonry, Restauranteur for example).This book has some value for those that have not read similar books of this type.  Otherwise, I would take a pass on this one
books||4.0||I like most of Jack Kornfield's work and this book is no exception.  It has a lot of good stories that are very entertaining and each of them illuminates important spiritual truths.  The focus of this book is on misconceptions about enlightenment and samdhi experiences.  Also, it contains some beautiful accounts of samdhi experiences taken from various religious traditions.  There is a lot of practical wisdom in this book about finding meaning on the spiritual path and in life in general.  Jack Kornfield dispels the illusion we are ever a finished product or that our various personality quirks will ever disappear completely.  In one section, he quotes Ram Dass who once was asked, did you get rid of all your personality problems and he replied, "no.. but I've become a connoisseur of my neurosis."  In another section, Jack talks about vocation or purpose in life.  I found this to be particularly well done and personally meaningful.  While the book is good, I think you may get more out of the audio CD because you get to hear the tone of his voice and inflections.  I think this carries a part of the communication that doesn't come across in his books.My favorite taped work by Jack Kornfield is your Buddha Nature.  This is on the 10 paramitas (perfections) and I think it represents his most poignant expression of his thinking on life.  If you like After the Ecstasy, the Laundry... you may want to consider purchasing this as well

Unfortunately, some songs like Marry The Man  Today, My Time Of Day, Follow The Fold and The Oldest Established have been  left out from the book, but that is the price you pay, or rather don't pay,  when you don't buy the full vocal score. However, this book will satisfy  fans of the show, complete with pictures from the original 1950 Broadway  production, the 1955 film, and the New 1992 Broadway Revival. Definately,  this book is a good buy
books||4.0||When I first started reviewing children's books on Amazon.com I gave myself a long list of rules to follow.  And one of those rules stated that I was not to read other reviews of a book on the site until AFTER I'd written my own review.  I wanted my little writings to remain unsullied and pure, filled only with my own thoughts (which I obviously mistook to be brilliant) and feelings.  After a while though I gave up on this rule.  By and large (and this is not speaking for all reviews... just 90% of them) a review for a children's book goes something along the lines of "It was good, my four-year-old requests it every night, buy this book, etc.".  Nothing too shocking or revealing.  So I grew lazy.  I started reading other reviews of picture books long before I sat down to actually write a review of my own.  Just moments ago I went to do the same thing for the beautiful picture book, "Martin's Big Words".  This book was on my list of must-reads because it had garnered itself a Caldecott Honor years before.  So I went to the appropriate Amazon.com page (much as you are now) and read the first review on the list.  At the time, it was an unassuming July 18, 2002 review entitled, "There's Something Wrong Here...".  I read the review.  I digested the review.  And I came to the inescapable opinion that the points raised in the review were good ones.  Ones that I should consider, dare I say, in my OWN review.  This is unprecedented.  Never has a review for a book, a children's book, really hit home for me like this one did.  So to that mysterious reader who thought to make a point back in 2002, I commend you.  And to myself, a mental whipping for breaking my own rules.  It's a hard act to follow, but I've a point or two of my own to make and I'm gonna make `em.	Now  as a children's librarian I get a whole heaping helpful of small children coming in around January 17th (or just before) requesting books on Martin Luther King Jr.  For the older children, such requests are usually easy enough to fulfill.  But for little ones with short attention spans and even shorter vocabularies, the choices are limited.  Fortunately, there's, "Martin's Big Words".  A beautiful encapsulation of the life of the great man, the book shows Martin as a child, first encountering the insanity of segregation.  We see him grow up and preach a gospel of love and acceptance.  Following this are small looks at the 1955 Montgomery bus boycott, civil rights marches, and his 1964 Nobel Peace Prize.  Finally, while marching with striking garbage collectors (a fact not often mentioned in children's biographies of King), he was shot and killed.  Says the book at the end, "His big words are alive for us today".  	The book is stunning to look at, you know.  The endpapers consist of pane after pane of brown, peach, amber, and umber stained glass.  Taken together, the stained glass appears to be a variety of different skin tones all working together to make something beautiful.  Using collage, illustrator Bryan Collier peppers his unique style with symbolic images (such as four lit candles placed in remembrance of the girls killed in the Sixteenth Street Baptist church).  In the rest of the book, Collier's images leap off the page.  They're bright, colorful and eclectic.  Combined with author Doreen Rappaport's elegant eloquent narrative, children get a full understanding of the courage and greatness behind Dr. King's life and actions.  	So what about the complaints of this book?  Let's examine them fully.  First of all, one criticism is that in the image of the civil rights march there are thirteen men on display, none of whom are either white or female.  This is true.  And it is a little odd.  Not don't-buy-this-book odd.  Just why-did-the-illustrator-make-that-choice odd.  From looking at the picture I can only assume that Collier was working off a snapshot of a portion of a march from the past and didn't notice that it was a bit skewed.  The other criticism of the book is that whites are only portrayed as evil rednecks that want to kill Dr. King.  I dunno.  The book says plenty of things about diversity and the coming together of the races.  As for the lack of positive white images, I admit they're not present in this particular book.  However, the world is filled to overflowing with books that DO present positive images of white people.  As a white person myself, I'm sick to death of 'em.  And I'd gladly exchange four or five hundred such books for a single one that was half as beautifully illustrated and written as "Martin's Big Words".  	So yeah, the book has a flaw here or there.  But it also fills a need.  However important you deem it that your children see positive images of whites during the Freedom Marches is your prerogative.  But don't pass "Martin's Big Words" by because it fails to fully display the diversity of the 60s in your eyes.  It's a great book with a great message.  It's also one of the few King bios that'll capture your seven-year-old's attention for longer than a minute.  A great addition to any library and a necessary purchase for anyone who wants to teach their small child about a magnificent man.
books||2.0||This is another offshoot of the commercially successful predecessor. The book traces the history of the knights templar and their supposed transformation into free masons. Much of the discussion focuses on free masonry, including its role in the American Revolution. I found the factual support lacking and the prose quite uninspired
books||2.0||This book, by the way, was published in 1988, NOT 1998 as the notes above indicate. It is also reflected in the books theme and attitude.I have read three chapters so far and this is what I have gleaned from the book:1) Your daughter will only be "successful" if she chooses male oriented occupations.2) Your daughter will only be "successful" if she is a doctor, NOT a nurse. Heaven forbid she be a nurse, housewife, teacher.3) Your daughter won't be "successful" if she goes to a coed school. Send her to a female only institution, that way she only has to compete against other girls.4) Your daughter won't be a success without playing poker, chess or other strategy games. Don't even think of pulling out Dora or some other "girl" game.Surely there must be better books for Dads to gain some info on theie daughters and ways to help them along as they grow. I could go on with more examples from this feminist rant, but frankly don't have the time. My daughter and I are going to kick the soccer ball.And BTW, don't even let her enjoy an english class or play with dolls. Force her into that science and math slot. Sign her up for computer camp because we all know that PC's are designed strictly for boys.I really feel this book is outdated, both in examples and most importantly, attitude. Try something different.
books||5.0||The insights here are simple, straightforward and profound. It explains how modern society can sometimes put men into a no-win situation, resulting in a feeling of frustration, impotence, incompetence, and depression. The only socially acceptable way to express it is rage (even though rage is vilified, I can tell you that showing hurt, pain and weakness invites scorn, distain and disrespect, even from those who purport to love us). By explaining how we get into this trap, it helps us to understand it and thus gives us a chance to find a way out. I wish I could give a copy of this book to every man and woman in the world. I see so much of it played out every day all around us, and the pain both men and women feel because of it does so much damage. Read it before you have a crisis if you can, but if you are already in crisis, make the effort to read this book even if you can't read anything else. It might even save your life. Believe me, I know what I'm talking about.
books||5.0||This is the best Rich Dad book to date.  The book is filled with priceless information that 90% of people in the U.S.(particularly baby-boomers) are clueless about today.  Most Rich Dad fans will know that Kiyosaki's books tend to talk about the same general principles and don't touch on many new and groundbreaking concepts.  This book, however, is the exception.  I learned so many eye-opening things from this masterpiece.  It has truly changed my life and the way I look at money.  Do yourself a favor and BUY THIS BOOK.   
books||1.0||I was very excited about receiving this book, by the way big upps to lupo997 for getting my book to me in a timely fashion.  After reviewing the book further I realized it was like Touched by an Angel, and I don't like that show at all, but I decided to read it anyway cause it looked good.  That was a mistake, the character's were two dimensional and truly unbelieveable.  In the first story - Rainmaker - The Professor was sooo in love with Hailey he didn't care about getting killed or putting his own child's life in danger - come on now.  He would rather see his blind daughter killed for this woman he barely knows.  I didn't even read the second story, maybe I'll come back to that.  The third story was totally ridiculous as well.  Paris is so sick of Russell - he doesn't have a job, money and no ambition, yet she stays with him.  He cheats on her, she has the broads up in her house and sells them Mary Kay!!  Yet she stays with him.  He has given her an STD!!!  She stays with him!!!  She doesn't even like making love to him.  During all of this nonsense her fi-one boss is pushing up on her, and she resists.  She won't cheat on her man.  What!!!!  If you like reading fairy tales then this is the book for you.  For everyone else who likes a little believable drama in their fiction - DO NOT GET THIS BOOK!
books||5.0||Narrated through the heartfelt voice of Amy Tan, the Kitchen God's Wife illustrates a compelling story of heritage and self-discovery. As a young Chinese woman, Winnie Louie, the main character and the conduit through which Tan expresses her voice, must endure an atrocious life under the abuse and torture of her wicked husband Wen Fu, a pretentious, arrogant, and egregious man who not only cheated his way up the military ladder, but also committed numerous felons including rape, murder, blackmailing, and extortion. Day after day, beating after beating, Winnie slowly begins to realize that in order to escape from Wen Fu and start a new life free from violence and marked by love, radical and immediate actions must be taken. When dealing with someone without even a modicum of human decency, someone like Wen Fu, the usual, traditional, and orthodox actions are futile. Striking a perfect chord between concision and elaboration, Tan keeps the reader constantly engaged as the dramatic story of Winnie unfolds itself. Relying mostly on authentic voice and keeping the meretricious elements to a minimum, Tan narrates the novel with surprising precision and unmatched beauty. Against the magnificent backdrops of a WWII-era China, the novel reassures the universal nature of mankind, that the problems troubling people today are experienced by all generations, regardless of race, nationality, or social status. As you read this rare gem amount literature, open the introspective window and enjoy the novel with your heart.
books||5.0||Peter Robinson is one of my favorite authors.  When I travel on vacation I make sure to take his latest novel.   "Piece of my Heart" transitioned between the present and a time about 25 years ago.  The characters were well developed and the story line moved.  There were many layers of sub-plots that were interwoven.  I thoroughly enjoyed how everything was brought to its final conclusion. 
books||2.0||When I traveled in Japan with a friend, this was the book we brought with us.  Within a week we were at a foriegn language bookstore in Tokyo looking for a better one.  There are some things this guide does quite well -- it helped us out finding reasonably priced places to stay throughout the country, and the advice to get a JR pass was invaluable.  However, the book has a very negative, immature view of Japan as a country and travel in general.  It seems to be written by bitter expatriates with a fascination with gaijin bars and the sex trade.  Did I pay $1200 for plane tickets to go drink with Americans?  The authors express a bias against culturally interesting sites, ancient and modern, that borders on the anti-intellectual.  The cultural notes are dated, inaccurate, and shallow.  After a while, we began to think, "If Lonely Planet doesn't recommend it, it's probably interesting."  The maps, as many have mentioned, are almost useless.  Ironically for a series which fetishizes getting off the beaten path, it's practically useless once you get out of the main tourist areas. There are much better guides available.  This entry has sworn me off the LP series for life.
books||2.0||This book is old news and is filled with predictions for 2005 & 2006 - most of which are inacurate.  His boom and subsequent bust theories are not materializing - and at this point even if they do will be of much smaller scale than his grand predictions (DOW over 40,000) presented in this book
books||5.0||I loaned my copy of Dr. Streicher's book to my mother who thought she may need a hysterectomy.  My mother reported that Dr. Streicher's book had information on topics she couldn't find elsewhere -- even about laparoscopic procedures which she hadn't heard about before.  Dr. Streicher's book helped educate my mother so that she was an informed patient and knew what questions to ask her own doctor.  Fortunately, it was determined that my mother did not need to have a hyesterectomy.  My only problem with this book is getting my copy back from my mother.  I may need to purchase a new one.  I think it is a "must-have" for any woman 40+ -- even for men whose partners/spouses/girlfriends are facing this
books||2.0||Most books that set out to explain why organisms behave as they do describe observations of behaviour on almost every page. The books of Richard Dawkins, whom Rose selects as his special target, illustrate this well: readers can reject all of his interpretations while remaining fascinated by the purely factual information that they contain. How one can hope to convince anyone of the truth of a theory without supporting it with abundant facts? Yet hard biological information is extremely sparse in Rose's book. There is a great deal about what he thinks of other biologists' opinions, but almost no observations from behavioural biology. Nonetheless, in his preface he aligns himself with the practising biologists "who spend a significant part of every working day thinking about and designing experiments", dismissing Dawkins and Daniel Dennett as "people who either no longer do science or never did it." What a pity, therefore, that he chose to include so little of the experimental basis of his ideas in his book. There are a few vague remarks about how chicks behave, and that's about it. 
books||1.0||This is one of the worst books ever, don't buy it
books||5.0||Very good book but only buy it if you are looking for a book with a very strange sense of humor. In the first story he explains his job as an Elf at Santaland and describes his daily life. It is so funny, some of the things people do there are amazing and crazy at the same time.Don't buy this book if you are looking for a nice book to read to your young kids or just sit in front of the fire reading a romantic book while it is snowing outside.But if you are looking for something funny and odd at the same time, then by all means buy this book
books||5.0||i am a kindda new wife but struggling with learning how to grow up and not be a nag.  stormie is very easy to understand in her book and can relate to almost anyone. like another person said i do feel like this book was written just for me.  the written prayers help me bc sometimes i dont know how to pray for my husband and this gives u the words to say and scripture to back up everything she says.  also, it helps me more importantly be a better wife. this isnt a book to try to get ur way and mold and change ur husband. i'd say its about giving urself up to The Lord to change u and make u a better wife . and praying for ur husband is selfless and probably one of the most important things u could be doing. i highly recommend this book, highly.  it changed me almost instantly! 
books||5.0||After viewing the German artistic mini-series for television many years ago, I decided to read this German family story to rival Galsworthy's Forsythe Saga. I was not disappointed, because this book deals, among others, with one essential aspect of human existence: man's difficulty in adapting to hardships and changes in social status. The story of the Buddenbrooks is a story of moral values among individuals who, although belong to the same family, can be astonishingly different in their understanding of life and their grasp of reality. In this family we see characters who are able to adapt, understand the world and compromise, while at the same time we are exposed to those who are limited by their own upbringing to a life of limited flexibility and eventual disillusion and self-abandon. This fundamental book of world literature attacks two antithetic facets of human nature, two views of the world that are constantly at battle within all human beings. It is for this reason that "Buddenbrooks" is fundamentally an allegory about man and his internal turmoil with the major challenges of life, a carefully crafted story with psychological insight that makes the reading of this book definitely worthwhil
books||2.0||There isn't anything in this book that you won't find in Warren Buffett's annual letters to the shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway (available for free at the Berkshire Hathaway website).  If you've not read those letters then I suggest you get right to it - they clearly lay out Mr Buffett's approach to investing and are written in a very easy to read, humorous and homely style.This book pulls many of the highlights from those letters together in one place and lays out some major tenets and themes that could be said to make an investment "Buffett like".  If you're not familiar with Warren Buffett and have not read his letters to the shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway - then you will likely find this to be a good introduction to Buffett.  Anybody else should probably steer clear as there isn't anything new here.
books||2.0||I've read only a few of Hillerman's previous Leaphorn/Chee novels. I've enjoyed what I've rtead, though they are an acquired taste, and I don't indulge in them very often. I tend to enjoy the earlier, more active years of Joe Leaphorn more interesting than his ' semi-retired unofficial advisor to Jim Chee' phase. From what I gather, 'Skeleton Man' continues a recent trend of disappointment with Hillerman's last few novels. Even without having read the books immediately prior to this one, I can understand that sentiment.'Skeleton Man' starts off with a rather risky premise, tying the story in with the real life collision over the Grand Canyon in 1956. While an author can occasionally pull off a good story with a strong connection to 'real life'(See Nelson De Mille's 'Night Fall'), Hillerman fails here.The story is bogged down with bland and unlikable supporting characters, flimsy motivation, and very little that could really be called 'action'.Chee ends up joining Leaphorn in the background for much of the story.The spiritual and ritualistic aspects of Hillerman's earlier books are, for the most part, glossed over here. Even what should have been a major plot development (Chee's wedding) is overshadowed by Chee have to rescue Manuelito, in the manner of far too many contrived 'Superman rescues Lois' situations. Better to stick with Hillerman's earlier novels. The 'aging athlete past his prime' analogy suits Hillerman, I'm afraid
books||4.0||This is the sort of book I have been looking for a long time. I've read other books on the Middle East which purport to have a similar focus, but which are instead incomplete, notably "Sowing the Wind". This book, by contrast, maintains the focus rather carefully and provides a concise history of the whole region. It looks as if the book was written as a textbook for (I would presume) grad students studying the subject, but really any intelligent person can pick it up and learn a great deal.An issue with a book like this is the tone of the work, how well the author writes. Kamrava isn't the second coming of Hemingway, but he's not too bad, either. The book is divided into two portions: first, a historical section that gives you an overview of the region's history, and second a topical section that looks at various issues that impact the region currently. The first section is very readable, the second less so (who actually enjoys reading about economics?). The author, however, does a good job (for the most part) of not sounding like a university professor telling you about something, though he does occasionally use words that are obscure, especially in terms of sub-regions of the Mid East.I still enjoyed this book, thought I got a lot out of it, and would recommend it. The author seems to be a hair more optimistic about the prospects for peace and prosperity in the region than I am, but he makes a good case for his point of view, and the result is interesting
books||1.0||I don't understand why anyone would publish a book anymore with black and white illustrations. I know this is supposed to be a classic and all that so it's my own fault for not checking when I read the description. I don't even know why I'm keeping it; I'll never read it. You have to wade through tons of technical jargon and lengthy chapters that would be much better served by some large color photographs. Maybe that makes me shallow, I don't know, but there are much more 'complete guides' out there on this topic these days
books||1.0||That so many people gave this book five stars really concerns me. Luckily, I bought this book used, otherwise I might be kicking myself for paying full price. Between her utterly uninspired "devotional dances" to things such as sex, wisdom, and the "Sticky One" (a term she made up for the astral body), and her constant blabber about masturbation and rubbing your juices all over everything to "anoint" it, I was unimpressed, to say the least. However, driving on a trip a friend and I got a lot of laughs out of flipping through this book. It's very, very amusing if you don't take it seriously. The thing that makes me sad is that she's just using her sexuality to sell a feel good waste of paper with absolutely no depth. There's nothing evolutionary about it, unless you consider being a wanton, idiotic freak "evolutionary". If this is what humanity is evolving into, I am frightend
books||5.0||I don't know why the other reviewers though it was a horrible book. It was absolutely captivating!  I was immediately enthralled in the story, and the has such a profound message.
books||1.0||Have you ever read a book that just seemed to drag on and on?  For me, that was this book.  If you like fantasy then you might like this, because that is the genre of this book.  It is about a Jewish girl named Hannah.  She goes to a family party and hears a knock on the door.  She opens it and then sort of wakes up and she thought it was a dream.  She now has a new name, Chaya.  She now has to figure out what happened, and what she will do in this body.  It takes place in New Rochelle.  It is old times.  It doesn't give a specific time but you can infer by the clues and setting.  She doesn't know why this happened to her but she must try to fix it.	I didn't like this book at all.  I thought it was really hard to follow.  You have to pay attention throughout the whole book.  You can never daydream or you won't know why they are calling her a new name.  This was definitely made for older adults, or people with a higher reading level.  If you are a good reader and you like to challenge yourself, try this book.  I don't recommend this book if you are younger, or just not that well of a reader.  This is for very and I mean very good and high level readers.  I would say between the ages of 25-60 might like this book.  I don't think this book was a page turner.  I wanted to put it down, instead of not wanting to put it down.  It never sparked my interest.  Her being Jewish, and the book being a fantasy, I couldn't relate to anything that happened.  This book was hard to concentrate on.  If you look up for one second, you miss most of the story, so concentrate hard.  I couldn't relate to anyone. I am not Jewish.  If you are Jewish, you might actually understand this book better than I could.  I didn't like the genre.  It was all fake and totally unrealistic.  If you like that sort of stuff, then read this book, but I don't like fantasy.  I didn't like how it was written.  It was too hard to concentrate on.  I had to reread twice to find out why they are calling her a different name.  I never found any surprised in the story.  I could guess what would happen next.  It was predictable.  None of the chapters had cliffhangers.  If just was boring and that's it.  I thought it was extremely boring.  I didn't understand anything and I would rather do my homework, than read that book.  My mind wandered a lot.  I had to read sections over and over again.  I never believed the plot one bit.  With the story being fantasy, everything is farfetched.  I think older people would enjoy this book, because they would be the only ones who could understand it. 
books||4.0||I was forced to read this book for my graduate studies and I found it surprisingly helpful.  By filling out a basic personality inventory, this book will tell you what "style" of worker you are and then how to deal with people of other "styles."  I see this book being a hit with sales people who have to interact with many other people everyday.  But I can also see how this book could provide a foundation for learning how to work with other people in any environment.  If you are willing to make slight modifications to your personal behavior, this book gives you the skills to build great relationships.  I agree, however, with the previous reviewer's comments that this book does not go very deep, thus only 4 stars. Do not expect to change your boss into a nice guy just by reading this, but you can make your day-to-day dealings with him more enjoyable using these tactics.  (This is also an easy read... Took me 2 days!
books||1.0||Someone reported all my 3 negative reviews of Daniel Silva books and got them removed! Hmm, I wonder who that could be. I am rather annoyed at this because I spent quite a lot of time detailing why I didn't like one of the books, reasonably, I thought. Apparently, someone had decided that they did not follow the review guidelines. I used no profanities. OK, there were some spoilers, but not more than I usually read in other reviews. Not single worded, no phone numbers, no solicitations, etc. Maybe whoever it was just didn't like my negative review. Well, the last time I checked, the 1st amendment still applies in this country.OK, so let me try to post another review of why I didn't like this book without violating any review guidelines, and I'm not going to spend 30 mins on it like last time. I thought the book was very poorly written and very boring. I struggled through 1/3 of the book but the author could not capture my attention and I decided not to continue to the end. I've read a couple of other Daniel Silva books, but neither one of them could change my mind that he is an author that I don't like. I will not be buying any more of his books
books||4.0||Not only a terrific portrait of Louis B. Mayer, but a wonderful history of Hollywood movie-making.  My caveat is the portrait of Dore Schary.  While Eyman is fair in his depiction of the struggle between Mayer and Thalberg, Eyman found it necessary to choose sides in the Mayer Schary conflict in the last part of the book, possibly to "correct" the view of Mayer the Monster and Schary the savior in earlier Mayer bios.  His portrait of Schary, a man I knew, bears no resemblance to that decent, fair minded, and gifted man.  It is clear that he interviewed few surviving friends and family members of Schary.  Eyman claims that Schary had no knowledge of the making of musicals, yet Schary in his post MGM days produced a successful musical, "The Unsinkable Molly Brown."  Whatever good flims came from MGM during Schary's reign are dismissed as the work of others. He creates a portrait of Schary as a talentless hack, forgetting not only the good films Schary wrote in earlier days but the successful Broadway play he wrote about FDR, "Sunrise at Campabello."  He writes that Schary only spoke of himself in retirement.  I knew few older men who took such an interst in world affairs and the fortunes and misfortunes of his friends.  If he can get Schary so wrong, it forces me to question his other judgments.  Having said all that, I think this is a fine book, evoking old Hollywood with grace and style.

books||1.0||Wow, I was expecting a fun, light read, and in the first chapter already had to skim over a couple of paragraphs relating to "mishaps" that happen to animals in Zippy's life. Well, I thought, next chapter will be better. NOT. The next chapter included a graphic scene of chickens being slaughtered by shovels! Every chapter so far has had something very disturbing about animals in it! If you are sensitive to these things, I would not recommend the book. I'm not sure I'm going to finish it at this rate. Granted, I AM super-sensitive to any animal suffering, but this is really overload. I'm halfway through and so far this is the list: The aforementioned chicken slaughter, a neighbor stealing her cat and starving it in the basement, another neighbor looking to poison her cat, dog-sitting for friends and losing the dog and not worrying about it that much and finding him dead days later, her father going out with a shotgun to kill the dogs who massacred Zippy's pet chicken, joking about a neighbor enjoying "puppy stew", keeping her two dogs penned up, torturing a raccoon by holding in front of 30 braying hounds.... I mean, does that seem like a lot to you??? For a light-hearted "tender" memoir???? Jeez louise! I can't sleep at night from this book

Go to Borders, look thru their ipod books and find the one with your ipod in it, if you have a brand new one as at May 2006.
books||4.0||   Harvey is a totally spoiled boy. It starts when Harvey is on a ship with his Mother (I forget where they are going) he is washed overboard, and saved by a fisherman `Manuel.' On the fishing boat Harvey makes his first friend, learns to work for his keep and so on. The story worked, it wasn't cheesy, maybe because it was one of the first novels of that type, but the plot of Harvey "growing up" seemed just to be there so you will read the book. The characters were well developed except the cook, you never really figure out where he is coming from. Most of the book was about fishing of The Grand Banks, very interesting is you like fishing and ships, but if you are reading it for the story, there is not that much, the ending was also weak, we are happy the Harvey is reconciled, but I really think that his parents would make a bigger stink. Good historical value, Kipling is a very enjoyable writer, yes I liked it but the plot had some flaws. I do recommend it though.
books||5.0||This is the third book I have read by Grisham, and so far I have really enjoyed each one. Grisham really knows how to write a good legal thriller. This book does not have any courtroom/court-case scenes, which I really enjoy, but it still kept my attention very well. Grisham gives you just enough "inside details" to keep you guessing without actually telling you the answer. For example: at one point, the clues seemed to point to Fletcher Coal being involved in the killings, but that was way off the mark in the end. This characteristic of Grisham's writings makes for a very enjoyable read.One of my few complaints about this book is the sudden romance between Gray and Darby. They had hardly even met before they seemed to become attracted, then it VERY quickly blossomed into an open show of affection, even though at the same time, Darby was supposedly mourning for Thomas. Even so, that is probably the main thing that seems wrong about this book, and it does not detract from the overall quality very much at all.Overall, this is a very captivating, page-turner book that really holds your attention. I highly recommend it, as well as Grisham's other books. So far, I have found Grisham to be an awesome writer of legal thrillers. I promise that you will not be disappointed. Read and enjoy
books||4.0||The plot is stronger than Dick and Jane, not quite at the Dr. Seuss level.  But my 4-year-old loves the thing.  He wants to read it - what more can one ask for a first reader than self-motivation?   Good illustrations,  basic vocabulary, frequent repetition, and not scary
books||1.0||Another farce to feed irrational hatred with authoritative sounding documentation... If you dig that sort of thing... there are tons out on the market...Unfortunately they don't come with disclaimers. like one would get when reading a book on the occult... People tend to go for books that support their bigoted view, and this is a fine example... it is a lucrative business in the united states to see what is en vogue and write a book of it.... It is a living. When the Da Vinci code was written it was a craze everyone had to write the idiot's guide to the code, how to interpret the code etc etc.... I am not surprised of a book like this and certainly there is no accounting for integrity or lack thereof... people write for years even for the NY times before others discover their plagiarism.... or in this case the secret agenda.... before long we will all be drafted to support capitalistic oligarchies err democracy abroad...
books||1.0||The sub-header to this book could very well be: "All Work & no Play makes Jack a Dull Boy". Basically, Tom Stanley's scholarly treatise on American wealth comes down to this mind-ripping, continent-blasting conclusion: Millionaires, you see: 1) Save more than they spend; 2) Don't spend anything. That's it. Page after page, chart after chart, graph after graph, anecdote piling up on anecdote, all of it boiling down to the same conclusion: don't spend more than you save. Clip coupons. Hang on to your wife `til Death you do Part. Buy a rambler for 80 grand, and cling to it like a rat clutching a Big Mac in a hurricane. To wit: if you're a good little Bob Cratchit, and burrow down in your suburban Dacha, drive the Civic, eat Top Ramen, and take your vacations at the State Museum of Knitting & the Fine Arts, you'll die loaded!Sound like fun? Didn't think so. Look: you've got one life, and after death all bets are off. Sure, you could be hauled up by the angels to Paradise, or it could just be one plate of linguini too many, a nasty flatline and one vast inky void of non-consciousness. Either way, you're looking at one single trip on this not-so-flat Earth, so you might as well live large. It's true, now: you can haul in major bank in whatever profession you choose: eremetic horror-writer, Wall Street tycoon, Railroad baron, small-town librarian, legal eagle defender of the Criminally Insane, whatever. And you can always outspend it. That is the source of endless tragedy and Dickensian woe throughout the ages, without a doubt.But there pitfalls at the other extreme. Listen: I live next door to one of these McMillionaires. The guy is this enfeebled little wizened gnome of a critter, used to be a bank Vice President and got bought out because he was a dingus. Total skinflint. Miser. Goes on his own hunting trips and brings back venison, deer meat, which he forces his family of---jesus, I think 12---to eat for months. Lives in a shacky little rambler, buys used Crown Vics from the local police department and bargain basement prices. The guy, no doubt, is high net worth. But he's also a loser. This is a guy who didn't want to cough up a few hundred bucks to help build a joint fence between our properties---so there's a fence, even a fence that abuts his property---but beyond my house and demesne, he elected not to build a fence. Instead, he got a plastic Jersey Barricade (orange and white) and went with that. Is that any way to live? Is that really what it means to be a `millionaire'?I think not. Half the glory of the Age of Great American Consumption is buying stuff you don't need, but want. Desire. Demand. What else is work for?  Find a way to creative bliss, work at something you're good at, that you have a real passion for, and the money will follow. But for the Love of God, it's only Money: spend it! What is money for, if not to indulge yourself? Sure, get a pace---plan to the end---set a budget. But how many of you want to be that newspaper column on page A3, the 95 year old dowager pauper who begged for alms on the streetcorner, ate catfood out of a tin, and scrounged for quarters by the bus stop, then was found rigid and cold in the urine-stiff sheets of her dirty bed, sprawled atop a fortune estimated at 20 million bucks? Sound like a plan? I think not. Money may not buy happiness, but it sure as hell can get you a Rolls-Royce Phantom. "Millionaire Next Door" might have it right in its sociology---and for what it is, Stanley's thesis is meticulously researched, mustered like a well-trained army, and capable of marshalling its teeming forest of facts like a well-drilled martinet---but it's off the map when it comes down to the point of the whole thing: if you've got it, flaunt it. "Millionaire Next Door" isn't a bad book: it's scholarly, and plods along its own hand-me-down lodestar towards its prophesied conclusion (be cheap! Die loaded!), and perhaps some folks will be astounded to discover there are some real richies down the block who in another day would have been called skinflints. But as a map to your stars, this one is a little cramped, cribbed, dank, and stinks of mothballs. I think I'll take first class---scratch that, how much did you say that Learjet was going for, again?

books||5.0||Boston is trembling under the shadow of a serial murderer with a notably gruesome method of dispatching his victims - brutal, savage rape, an obviously knowledgeable, skillful removal of the uterus while the victim still lives with the coup de grace coming as a slashed throat and severing of the carotid artery! Little wonder the media has awarded him the moniker "The Surgeon". In the course of their investigations, detectives Thomas Moore and Jane Rizzoli discover an earlier case with a virtually identical MO in Savannah in which the murderer, Andrew Capra, was ultimately killed by a stalwart would-be victim who fought back and shot him before he could finish the job! They are startled to discover that the surviving victim, Dr Catherine Cordell, is a noted cardiac surgeon currently practicing in a major Boston hospital, and beyond all belief in the possibility of coincidences, she appears to be the target of the now active killer!Once again, Gerritsen has unerringly brought her intimate knowledge of medicine and the hospital milieu to the table. But, contrary to what one might fairly expect from Gerritsen's past work, has successfully served up a compelling investigative police procedural which lovingly details the forensics, the pathology, the profiling and the gut-wrenching detail in the relentless task force style search for a psychopathic serial murderer! Several superbly paced sub-plots are inextricably woven into one another as the story unfolds - Cordell's slow recovery from the assault she endured two years ago and her halting re-integration into life and the hospital work force; Jane Rizzoli's bristly temperament as the lone Boston female homicide detective and her work-life struggles against the "old boy" attitude of the police force; Thomas Moore's extended grieving period over the untimely loss of his dearly loved wife and the difficulties he faces as he recognizes his entirely inappropriate blossoming romantic feelings for Catherine Cordell; the task force style investigation of "The Surgeon" and his relationship with the long dead Georgia killer; and, Cordell's daily life in the cardiac ward and the emergency room of the hospital and the brilliantly described relationship she maintains with her working partner, Dr Peter Falco.Not only does Gerritsen handle all of this with skill and aplomb but, with every passing page and each successful murder, she ratchets up the suspense as we realize the killer is taunting the police, honing his skills and reaching for Catherine Cordell as his ultimate target. Yet he constantly remains one step ahead of the investigation.A great addition to the library if, like me, you love your easy reading page-flipping thrillers!Paul Weis
books||1.0||I'm not sure who's writing these reviews, but I read repitition after repitition after repitition, with a lot of confusing fluff. Asking hard questions to solve complex or simple issues. What's "fierce" about that? The writing style and content just didn't flow. Wasn't real. I mean, in one section, she actually uses the term "bucko," as in, "Let me tell you something, bucko." What are we in "Happy Days?" Couldn't take the book seriously after that. Very bad.
books||5.0||I'll skip the description since that has been done so many times here. But I would like to say that I don't have much time for reading, so make sure the books I choose are those by authors I consider 5-star. J.D. Robb a/k/a Nora Roberts is one of the most prolific authors I've ever read. How she manages to produce books that remain fresh and vibrant attests to her incredible talent and creative imagination. I've read this series out of order, but each book is written so that the book itself can stand alone. This one, however, revealed to me the reason behind Eve's sometimes belligerent attitude, her strong persona, and standoffishness. Robb is great at revealing subtle conflicts, inner turmoils. Great book

books||5.0||A moving story of a family of all boys from New Zealand who have a young sister named Meggie. They are hardworking lower class people who work the land and shear sheep. When the family moves to Australia to inherit property, young Meggie becomes bonded to the local Priest from the first day she saw him. As she grows up, the friendship blossoms into a school girl crush, then a first kiss. Meggie wants the relationship to go further... but she is not able to get her wish. Young Meggie is in love and is not able to forget Fr. Ralph no matter what she does. She soon moves away from the family homestead by becoming married to Luke O'Neal, a substitute for Fr. Ralph. Her marriage to Luke is terrible and she is extremely miserable. Fr. Ralph, in a moment of weakness and concern for Meggie's health, comes back into the picture. He cannot forget the love he had for Meggie either. Both are not able to say no and their passion overwhelmes them. The consequences of their act plague them for a lifetime... a remarkable story showing the vunerability, yet obedience to the priesthood
books||2.0||In the post 9/11 world in which this book, subtitled "The Clash Between Islam and Modernity in the Middle East" was published, it should not be surprising that the reader would anticipate a discussion of the factors that led up to that awful day. This, however, is not to be found in What Went Wrong?Instead we are treated to a cerebral discussion of various and sundry esoteric minutiae. We learn, for instance, that, "A distinguishing characteristic of Western music is polyphony, by harmony or counterpoint. This begins in its simplest form with the choir, in which matched voices sing different notes in a planned sequence to produce a combined effect; then comes the keyboard instrument, matching the ten fingers of the two hands, following different routes in a common purpose; and finally, the musical ensemble, from duets and trios to the full orchestra". While this is all well and good, and may even be mildly interesting on some academic level, it is hard to understand how it plays into a discussion of "The Clash Between Islam and Modernity..." that has led to the precarious times in which we live.Or, on another note (harmony? counterpoint?) we learn that Robinson Crusoe was translated into Arabic by Butrus al-Bustani and published in the late 1850's. Big deal!What we don't learn anything about is the rise of militant Islamism. There is no mention of Wahhabism or how this fundamentalist Islamic movement contributed to the rejection of modernity. The Muslim Brotherhood also is not to be found in the index, nor is there a mention of Sayyid Qutb, or his writing of the incendiary manifesto, Milestones. Furthermore, there is not a single reference to al-Qaeda, though Usama bin Laden does appear, albeit seemingly as an afterthought, in what appears to be a hastily added Afterword.So what went wrong?Beats me..
books||1.0||While entertaining, I found several times that the story slowed down and got a little preachy about the politics of drug money. While probably true it distracted from the story by being repeated and heavy handed. I also found the timeline hard to believe. Maybe because I have lived in the area and understand the distances (and traffic) travelled in short periods of time. I am a big Elizabeth Lowell fan  (as well as Ann Maxwell) but this was not one of her better books
books||4.0||First off, I have to admit: I am 22 years old and read the entirety of this book in one 7 hour sitting on my way to Paris.I picked up the novel out of sheer curiosity and personal research for my job. I work at Barnes & Noble and am in charge of both the Teen and Children's sections. When our store sold out of New Moon within a week of initially getting the book, my curiosity was piqued -- I felt I had to give its predecessor a try so I knew what the hype was about and could give an honest opinion about the book.Now here I sit and I have finished both Twilight and New Moon. I have to admit -- Meyer has a talent. Both books I read at breakneck speed, barely stopping to eat or sleep. Her prose is smooth and easy, accompanied by a plot that I found engrossing. I went back after reading Twilight and re-read my favorite sections more than once. The love story was hypnotizing and surprisingly seductive. I definitely plan on recommend this book, mainly to teenage girls who will swoon over Edward.However, I only gave the book four stars. While I enjoyed it immensley as I read the novel, a few things bothered me upon looking back: 1) While Meyer deinitely has a talent for writing an engaging novel full of beautiful descriptions, the character descriptions at times felt extremely lazy. If I had to read one more time about Edward's marble, angelic face (what, exactly, does that mean??), his liquid topaz eyes, or how Bella glared at Edward, I thought I was going to pitch the book down the aisle of the plane.2) I'm not sure I buy their romance. It was heartstopping and climactic during the read, but honestly, what DOES he see in her? If Bella keeps asking that question to herself, maybe her audience shoud seriously consider it. 3)Bella herself bothered me. I found Bella to be horribly dependent on Edward to the point that I got irritated with her. And her constantly having to catch her breath around Edward -- Puh-leeze. Be a woman! Stand on your own feet! She never fully developed into a character for me since she revolved solely around Edward, something that I, as a self-sustained woman, cannot connect with.And lastly, 4)Bella wants so desperately to become a vampire, but that seems like it could pose a problem between herself and Edward. Since I haven't seen any evidence that Edward likes Bella for any other reason than that she smells wonderful (a scent that she has because she is human and has blood coursing through her veins, mind you), what happens when she no longer smells good? Meyer is really going to have to prove to me that Edward actually loves Bella for other reasons than her smell, otherwise it will be completely unbelievable if Bella turns into a vampire and Edward is still attracted to this ordinary girl...Although the plot has its shortcomings, I still thoroughly enjoyed it and that is why I give it four stars. I will read the next one when it comes out, and any other subsequent after that, for the simple reason that the books are entertaining and Edward is so dang alluring

I really like how most of the recipes don't require many special ingredients and how simple the directions are.  I was a little apprehensive having made the decision to become a vegetarian but this cookbook gave me confidence I'd still be able to enjoy a flavorful variety of cuisine

It is the perfect winter read and holiday gift. It is witty, engaging and even touching at times.  My mother said it was the only thing that made her laugh out loud during her double knee replacement rehab!  I am giving this book to all my friends this year.
books||1.0||I was expecting a substitute for the classic "Photoshop Channel Chops" by Monroy and friends.  It trivializes the subject with "How to unlock the hidden power of channels ... blah blah.If you want a better understanding of channels be prepared to wade through a lot of fluff with this one.  Infomercial.  
books||2.0||Hal Abelson is responsible for a famous epigram, "If I haven't seen as far as others, it is because giants were standing on my shoulders."This book is solidly enough written, but it's a cut-down, shallow rehash of a few justly famous functional programming textbooks.  The first is Abelson and Sussman's "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs"; the second, Bird and Wadler's "Introduction to Functional Programming".If you want to really learn deep truths about programming, go buy those two books.  If they leave you scratching your head about how to transmogrify what you learn into Perl, buy Schwartz's "Perls of Wisdom"
books||1.0||If the Kranks really did what they set out to do and skip Christmas, that would have been a good story.  The end.  Instead, they end up having to scramble to try & make Christmas "happen" for their daughter unexpectedly coming home.  In other words - a typical stressful material holiday, instead of a celebration of friends, family, or even, gasp! Christ's birth.  I agree - if you don't want to celebrate Christ's birth, if you don't want presents and holiday decorations and family time - skip it.  Why torture yourself?  It would have been a good story if they did this.  Instead, the plot deteriorated into a very stupid, ridiculous and unrealistic dash to the finish line of "making Christmas happen."  A completely unsatisfying and unfunny read.  Threw it away so others wouldn't have the displeasure of reading it
books||5.0||Great book!  It's comprehensive and easy to understand.  Highly recommended textbook. 
books||4.0||This was the book that got me to enjoy reading back in the day.  This was also my first Crichton, and I have to say I enjoyed it to the fullest.  Easy to read adventure novel
books||1.0||When I read this, I was not expecting to become a commie, but at least I was hoping for something more compelling than the pure hatred of people who have more than others and the racist concsipracy theories (especially re Jews) that the authors came up with.  I understand that people accord this book some respect because it has influcenced many people.  But that is what hate litterature does.  This book is especially powerful in its attempt to find sharp class lines to allow the "masses" to hate
books||5.0||I love this book - such a great novel detailing the friendship and bonds of a group of women over the years.  I'll be re-reading it
books||1.0||Buy a Girls Gotta Do What a Girls Gotta Do instead.  Snortland's book is more of a feminist's political treastise on how males and females are raised and nurtured versus a pragmatic approach on skills to identify potential threats and strategies to deal with them.  She does hype Impact training which sounds like a beneficial program. I bought it for my daughter, but read it first. Actually, I tried to read it; halfway through the book I  decided to toss it. 
books||5.0||I bought this book to learn some simple things to fold in a Kindergarten I used to work in, and it was an instant success! I was sat at the table for hours folding frogs and boats to the kids, and they seemed to really enjoy the creations! This is a great book for parents and pre-school teachers, and it is a great way to learn  a little bit about geometry too. Some of the models are difficult to understand, but folding is about taking your time. A great way of finding a corner of peace in our rush-hour lifestyle
books||2.0||Gail's writing is again wonderful in this in book, but I found the book disappointing due to a lack of closure. I felt the book led you up to a particular point in the life of the character's and then left you wondering in the end what the message was meant to be. I almost felt as if the writer wasn't brave enough enough to tell you the ending to a tragic, yet hopeful story. I can only compare this book to the Samurai's Garden since I haven't read a third book by this author yet, and I loved the Samari's Garden! So I was surprised that this book lacked closure at the end. I am not sorry that I read this book due to the fact that I enjoy the author's style of writing
books||5.0||I highly recommend this book.  It has changed the way I look at life and spirituality.  Nearly every line in the book is filled with profound meaning.  Additonally, the style is clear and the ideas accessible for anyone who is truly interested in spiritual fulfillment.  I am at greater peace with the world since having read this book.

books||5.0||As a prospective college student, I have to tell you how much I appreciate Students' Guide to Colleges. It combines many of the best features of the Princeton Review and Fiske guides with much more comprehensiveness. I also appreciate that it is without any trying-to-sound-hip blather because these are not editor-interjected profiles, they're written by actual students. This is a great compliment--I have been looking at colleges seriously for about a year, and this is the best guide to colleges among the many I've seen. I also just read the Oberlin College profile in this book with an Oberlin alum and relative. She said that this was this most comprehensive and accurate Oberlin portrayal she's read in a guide. Among other things, she and I loved the different student perspectives and the unthinkable-in-previous-guides questions like "what aspect of your school would a prospective student not see on a college tour?" The guide's honesty also impressed me, as the Fiske guide lauded Vassar's "diversity," for example, where Students' Guide admits "Although Vassar likes to talk about diversity a lot, most students are actually wealthy and white." I am confident in saying that anyone applying anywhere from Hampshire to Harvard will find this book incredibly useful!! -Josh

I found the story to be hopeless and defeating.  How sad the only comfort the father has to offer is composting tips and the last memory the child has to hold is that of a decomposing cat.  I'm no censor, but two thumbs way down.  Also, if you are looking for something wonderful for pet loss, try Cynthia Rylant's, Cat Heaven

books||5.0||This was the first novel I read from Endo, and I have to confess to being hooked on it from the first. It is both interesting from a historical perspective, taking in an event that was singularly fascinating, and deeply profound from a psychological perspective. It is also a partial critique of ambition and desire in the clergy of the day.Hasekura is a deep character, and the reader spends a bit of time with Hasekura's thoughts. This is especially so as Hasekura confronts the emaciated, dying Christ that he sees on his travels toward Rome. The possibility of faith in this "pathetic man", and the conflict that produces with his duty to Lord and ancestors, forms a a deeply emotional narrative coupled with Hasekura's desires, dreams and simple wishes. The psychological aspect of the book is very well presented and notable in its impact.A notable part of the book is tied up with Father Velasco, whose ambition seems to know no limits. His own struggles with ambition, and the self-justifications that he employs, are a lesson worthy of remembering. This novel is a great one, and I was hooked to the very last page. It will take you into the world of Hasekura, Velasco and their companions, as they themselves see it. It will take you into their dreams, their hopes, their fatalism, their fears and their struggles to cope with their situation. I totally, unreservedly recommend this novel. I love this novel
books||1.0||This book is essentially about how culture is used to promote the interest of stronger, imperial powers.  Said condemns intellectuals in the West who in his eyes are "agents of exploitation".  Yet Said himself is an agent of racism.  A Pan Arabist, he always supported Arab unity and "Islam" at the expense of non-Arab and non-Moslem peoples.  Said directs and manipulates the Western taste for self criticim, and all that does is deflect the world's attention from Arab and Moslem attrocities committed against Christians, Kurds, Jews, Israelis, Coptic Christians, non-Arab Sudanese, etc.  Thus, reading Said, you would never realize that Sadam Hussein's poisoning of the Kurds has never been condemned by one Arab intellectual or leader.  This is because a racist prevalent attitude in the Arab mind is that the entire Middle East should be Arab.  This also explains the attitude towards Israel, a country that is predominantly non-Moslem and speaks a Middle Eastern language other than Arabic.The pity is that Said himself is a Christian, yet he never spoke on behalf of Coptic Christians in Egypt, or the right of Christians to practice their faith in Saudi Arabia and probably other places in the Arab World.  He is facilitating the overall aim of PanArab Nationalists by distracting the West from what is happening in the Arab world.  For a better understanding of relations between the West and Islam, I recommend books by Bernard Lewis, such as "The Moslem Discovery of Europe" and the "Jews of Islam".  I also recommend books by the Egyptian scholar and Jewish refugee Yael Bat Yeor, such as "The Dhimmi". 
books||1.0||The title grabbed me because I have been noticing for, oh about 14 years now, the decline of the truth in this country.  Unfortunately, this book is written precisely by the kind of person who has lost touch with reality and what truth is (definition of irony I believe).The reason it is #1 on the bestseller list is because there is a ready audience out there, of similarly detached people, who want anything (and I mean anything - a website with a good conspiracy story and a glass of warm milk before bed everynight is their ideal) that backs up their point of view.  It is precisely why the truth is so out of fashion.  New media streams like the internet, blogs, etc. offer up "news" without accountability.  They allow this segment of society to avoid confronting the truth and instead construct their own alternative realities.  It makes people like Frank Rich, rich, with very little effort.  Why bother checking facts, his core readership doesn't care whether it is true or not, just tell them Bush is evil
books||1.0||I agree with the reader(s) who said this book totally contradicts itself and seems thrown-together, as if no one proofread it.  In one chapter she'll recommend something; then later on she'll tell you it's ineffective and/or dangerous!  She gives a long, long list of herbal supplements that are supposed to aid weight loss -- but she just repeats all the advertisers' claims without any comments, recommendations or opinions of her own.  Personally I think most natural/ herbal supplements are a ripoff, but if she had given any testimonials by people who've found them to work, I might consider trying them. On the whole, this book is a waste of money
books||5.0||One of the most interesting books I've ever read!  I could not put this one down.  If all economics books were written this well, everyone would want to be an economist!  The author has a unique perspective on the analysis of data that is very compelling.  He will make you question every "fact" you've ever heard and observe the world around you from a different angle
books||4.0||In the 1970's, Peter Singer came out with a radical argument which was new in the field of ethics; animal liberation.  While some philosophers and others had in the past, argued for the necessity of being kind to animals (Schopenhauer probably being the most notable case because of his deep respect for Buddhism), Peter Singer was probably the first philosopher in Western philosophy to set out a systematic rational set of arguments for regarding the rights of animals.  Singer's primary argument, and a very interesting one, is science has demonstrated we show very close connections to many kinds of animals, particularly in the structures of our vital organs, nervous systems and brains.  Singer gathers some strong evidence from biology showing how many animal species are apparently capable of feeling pain and hence of suffering.  On these grounds Singer argues animals are entitled to certain rights, at least when they are being used by humans.  The fact animals can suffer means we can't just treat them as another form of material object or resource for our use, but we need to consider them as fellow beings.  Singer builds up a set of arguments against eating animals, using animals in agricultural contexts, using animals for scientific experimentation, or using animals for commercial research such as the testing of cosmetic products.  Singer draws on some infamous and damning experiments which seem to have caused terrible pain and suffering to animals for little apparent gain in scientific knowledge, including the use of 'rape racks' and virtual torture of infant monkeys in one series of experiments.  At the end of the book, Singer presents several vegetarian recipies and hopes readers will stop eating meat on this example.Singer's work has been very powerful in its influence, and several philosophers built on and expanded on his work.  However, others have criticized his arguments quite strongly, on many grounds.  It has also become a kind of manifesto for many animal rights campaigners and animal liberationists, some of whom have resorted to violent means to 'free' animals from scientific experimentation.While I admire Singer's rigorous arguments as well as the formidable evidence he marshals to back it, I cannot entirely agree with them.  It seems that at least some scientific research involving animals is necessary for fighting many awful diseases and conditions which cause terrible human suffering.  I think a total ban on animal research, especially medical research and biotechnology research aimed at improving human health, is excessive.  Animals also form an essential part of the livelihood of many people around the world.  No doubt in many cases some practices lead to animals suffering, but does this mean all useage of animals in agriculture should be stopped?  Where do we make changes?  When do we make them?  I certainly agree agriculture should be done in such a way animal cruelty is removed, and suffering reduced as much as possible, but preventing all suffering is impossible, and reality will require compromise.  Also as another ecologist remarked, sometimes practices which cause harm to an individual animal is necessary to protect the overall ecosystem.  Hunting rabbits and kangeroos or cats or horses will cause suffering to these creatures, but is often a necessity in Australia where in many areas these animals are dangerous pests that ruin the native environment through overpopulation or hunting.  Still, the strongest thing in favour of Singer's thesis is that we do share a profound connection with nature, and our terrible disregard for the biosphere is coming back to haunt us in the form of mass extinctions of species.  We certainly need to redevelop a sense of what Edmund Wilson calls 'biophilia', a sense of affinity with nature and the natural world, rather than simply seeing it as another object to gratify our desires
books||5.0||Phyllis Chesler is a most unusual feminist. She really doesn't fit in with the equity feminist crowd and is a complete dissenter from the female superiority, gender feminist crowd. The one thing that makes her consistently worth reading is her passion for telling the truth. This seems to be her most pervasive (and endearing) feature as an intellectual, and the trait was ubiquitously on display throughout her recent "Death of Feminism" release. Here she tackles a verboten subject which is whether or not women are the unbridled source of goodness that many feminists assume them to be. Numerous examples of misapplied and unprovoked indirect aggression are identified and elucidated in the text. On the whole, it makes for compelling reading. We find that women are regular human beings just like everyone else. They have many of the same, yet subtlety different, characteristics as do men. In these pages, Chesler illustrates the magnitude of inter-woman hostility as their strong social skills can often be applied in a negative manner. Many mother-daughter conflicts are projected into adult situations. Why feminists wouldn't have wanted this published seems rather silly to me. We should regard women as they are and not as objects of fantasy. Chesler never implies any inter-sex superiority or inferiority, she is content to describe what is, and it's great stuff indeed.
books||5.0||This book was a gift given to me by a friend years ago. I own and have read about twelve books on the topic. Out of all of them, this has been by far the best. By the end it feels like a journey inside yourself has taken place and you arrive to a new destination on your insides. The feel of the book is one of love and support. Not the self-centered type, or author as guru type that I have read in other books--this one has the experience of two professional therapists that shows itself in each chapter. It made a large difference in my struggle with an eating disorder that started at age 10. I am now 44.

books||1.0||Sure this book is only for beginner or outsider of Cosulting business. But then, for the price of this book, I would rather buy a much cheaper book but with more useful information and ideas - such as Consulting for Dummies. The book is full of motherhood statements and it is more liked written by a grand mom and she called herself consultant; But come on, Consulting is a highly skillful business that require structural, systematic yet creative thinking. Overall, I think this book is a waste of money for experienced consultant. While for beginner, the reader will risk the wrong impression that it's this easy to win a consulting work - highly unlikely in a complex and competative world
books||2.0||If I had been an editor and received "Deadly Slipper",I would have said the following:"Dear Ms. Wan,Your book is unacceptable for the following reasons:1) The Setting.  One hazard of writing about the placewhere you spend your summers is that you end upwriting through the eyes of a visitor rather than anative.  Dordogne sounds delightful,and I'd certainlylike to visit it based on your descriptions ofdelightful pigeon coops and sheep scattered across thelandscape, but it is disturbing that you havecicadas singing in May.  It suggests you are onlyfamiliar with the setting during the vacation monthswhen you habitually visit. To really describe a place,I think you need to know it better.2) The characters.  Because you spend your summers inDordogne, you appear to know only other wealthyforeigners.  All your main characters are expatriateswith irritatingly bourgeois occupations.  I don't knowif you realize that all the native-born Frenchcharacters you portray are ugly, boorish, sexuallydepraved, mentally defective, criminal, or terminallyquaint, and they all appear to make cheese.  Surelythis isn't a realistic portrayal of the French.3) The Orchids.  Actually, the orchids are fine, butthe idea that orchid fanciers are maniacal andpossibly homicidal is a questionable one; most orchidfanciers are fairly tedious.  Also, the idea that a ladyslipper mutant would spontaneously occur and allow theorchid to live outside its native habitat is idiotic. Anyone would tell you that a hybrid is a better bet.4) The Dogs.  One cute dog is sufficient; two are toomuch.  Puppies are inexcusable.5) The Romance.  Most mystery writer are aware of thehazard of including a romance in a mystery, but youwalked in innocently, unaware that your two charactersare unpleasant, self-involved and have no chemistry(and that's not even mentioning their unspeakabledogs).  You set a big obstacle in their path by havingone think the other is a deranged serial killer; agreat writer might be able to pull this off, but youcan't. 6) Trendoid aspects.  Epistolary novels are *so* 18thcentury.  But having a NY psychiatrist profile theserial killer by email is so LAST WEEK.  You will besorry you did this, sooner rather than later.  7) The Ending.  Ridiculous and melodramatic.  Georges Simenon wrote about crime with great psychological acuity.  You should read one of his books.
books||4.0||It’s been two years since the recovery of The Amulet of Samarkand, and Nathaniel (now known as John Mandrake) is a Government official in the Office of Internal Affairs, apprenticed to Jessica Whitwell.His job is to hunt down a pack of rebellious commoners known as the Resistance, who have been causing a series of disturbances in London, aiming to destabilize the rule of the magicians.  He suspects the involvement of a girl named Kitty and her friends whom we met in his previous adventure, and although correct in this assumption, it soon becomes obvious that there is deeper evil afoot, as a destructive force hidden in a black cloud begins attacking the city, destroying buildings and magical artifacts as it goes.When things start spiraling out of control, he is forced to call upon Bartimaeus again for help, and the adventure spirals into a saga of grave robbery, political maneuvers, foreign travel and ancient magic.Though certainly not as good as the first, and a little too long, The Golem’s Eye makes for good reading, but is sadly lacking the sarcastic witticisms of everyone’s favorite djinn that were the high point of book one.Amanda Richards, May 20, 2006

books||5.0||This is a simple, yet heartfelt and elegant tale of the lives and struggles of women in rural China of the 1920s and 1930s. The story centers on Pei, who as a young girl, is sold by her parents to work in a silk factory.  The story evolves as Pei befriends other women in the silk factory, participates in a strike for fair working conditions, reconnects with her family, loses loved ones, and escapes from advancing Japanese soldiers. The plot is succinct and the characters are interesting, varied, and believable, if perhaps lacking somewhat in psychological depth.  Socio-cultural aspects of life in 1920s-30s China are elegantly woven into the plot.  Themes of friendship, love, and courage are convincingly presented.  Overall, the book is a captivating read, and strongly recommended.

We are all searching for a way to raise our children that allows them to develop the long-term life skills of confidence, responsibility, contribution and the ability to solve problems.  The schools that teach these skills in addition to academics have students that perform better in school and in life.  Using Positive Discipline will actually save you time in the classroom, and make your job and relationships with your students much more enjoyable.
books||4.0||You, the reader, are the subject and the hero of Calvino's novel, an exercise in reader-response theory gone mad. Calvino's lively experiment begins by describing a reader (that is, "you") reading Calvino's novel and, after this opening, "you" settle in to read the novel that you were "meant" to be reading--a noir mystery with a cliffhanger at the end of the first chapter. But all is not fair in the Land of Fiction; the copy of the book has been misbound by the printer, so you have to rush to the store to get a properly printed book--only to find that the replacement is a different book entirely. After several tricks and machinations, you end up reading the beginnings of ten different books, written in ten different styles, yet all sharing place and character names and even themes. (Part of the fun is identifying the author being imitated: the most obvious segments mock Borges, Dostoevsky, and Chekhov.)  While initially it seems that Calvino assumes you are male, soon you are introduced to the Other Reader and "you" see the story through her eyes. Both of you work to solve the mystery of the erratic book passages, and the pleasure of reading is heightened by romantic tensions between the two of you.	The book alternates between the story fragments and the story of "you." The repeated changes and interruptions in style and story can be baffling: "You can't get your bearings: the characters have changed, the settings, you don't understand what it's about, you find names of people and don't know who they are." It's a bit like "Groundhog Day," except that instead of being stuck inside the same day, you're doomed to repeat ten different but terrifyingly similar acts of literature interruptus. Well before the end of the novel, you realize that the real story is not to be found in any of the parodies (mysteries, fantasies, and romances) that you desperately try (and fail) to finish, but in the story of your reading experience itself--an experience made all the more complicated by the web of conspiracies engendered by the Other Reader, a reclusive popular writer, a charlatan churning out counterfeit books under the writer's name, a sloppy and conniving translator, and various officials of repressive dictatorships.For the reader who doesn't mind when an author attempts to describe your state of mind, Calvino's novel can be pure fun. The success of Calvino's task depends in no small part on whether the reading experience he describes recalls how you read a book; I know that some readers find some of these passages alien ("That's not how I read books"), but for me the various descriptions of the reading experience were both perceptive and eerily familiar. This reader, too, found the first half of the book far more engaging than the second half; later in the book, the gimmick inevitably wears a little thin and the detours that spoof publishing conglomerates, repressive governments, and state censorship were a bit more than this short novel could handle. And the "solution" to the puzzle, although fitting, has the oomph of the finale to a shaggy-dog story. No matter--if you enjoy metafiction, you might just recognize yourself in this clever book
books||2.0||This is a well written but ultimately sophomoric disquisition on the concept that if you don't have faith in the supernatural, you have no reason for hope. According to this book, the rational world is such an unpleasant place that, if you are not religious as Schaeffer defines religious, "[t]he only way of escape lies in a nonrational fantasy world of experience, drugs, absurdity, pornography, an elusive "final experience," madness... ."Piffle! Throughout history, a great many people found life to be good without resorting to either madness or Schaeffer's brand of religion. And indeed, religion and rationality need not be foes, as frequently demonstrated by scientists and science writers, such as Isaac Asimov and Stephen Jay Gould. Reduces our choices to "religion or madness" is just silly.Schaeffer in this book champions not religion or spirituality, but authoritarianism with a clerical face. His fans won't like that characterization, but my job as a reviewer is to tell you what's in the book; if you seek comfort in authoritarian religion, this book's skillful wordcraft makes it is a good place to start
books||5.0||The characters are Tom, a Navy seal specializing is counter terroism home on medical leave visiting his uncle, and Kally, a big-city doctor caring for her terminally ill father.  Sounds like a typical match for a romance novel, but this novel is so much more than that.  Kelly and Tom have a past, but her father and his uncle has an even bigger past.  All four of them have to draw on their pasts to protect the futures of themselves and many others.  Many long kept secrets must be bared and all their hearts must mend.I think I have yet another author to add to my favorite list.  This novel not only has a suspensful, gripping plot, but is packed with romance, and excitment on many levels.  Most romance novels are only about two people with various cameo appearances by several others.  Not so, with this one.  There are four different stories wrapped eloquently into one novel, and expertly blended to create the whole.  The reader is kept guessing and there are surprises around evey turn.  Some are pleasant and some sad.  This is truly a moving tale on all levels.  You won 't be dissapointed

books||2.0||Before purchasing Made in Detroit I read the reader reviews.  The reviews were so mixed that I decided against buying the book and checked it out of the library instead.  As it turns out I made the best decision.  All I can say is `thank you fellow reviewers'; this book was definitely not worth the purchase price.  My statement has nothing to do with the author's writing skills, he is a skilled writer.  It has everything to do with his lack of insight.  That Paul Clemens could live in a city and have such a skewed view of it is downright scary.  I read the book, waiting for Paul to have a revelation that would help him put the pieces of his life together and make peace with them.  But after 241 pages he was no more enlightened than he was on page one.  Blacks are caricatures whose sole role in life is to make Paul's life hard.  Women are peripheral characters who are barely given a voice.  He finds a way to put down and demean everyone who is not a white male in his book.  If you are a white male who harbors secret racist feelings you will enjoy this book and it will validate your feelings.  If you are anyone else your reaction will no doubt range from mild boredom to outrage.  As I read this book I felt sadness, a profound sense of dismay and had some of my worse fears confirmed.  (There are white folks who actually still think like this.)  My hope is that the light comes on for Paul, he is still young.  If it does maybe he will share his insights with us.

The author has introduced many specific healing techniques and symbol combinations that have produced amazing results for my clients.  She obviously has an incredible passion for Karuna Reiki because the book reads as if the energy itself wrote every word.
books||1.0||It is sad that this is what passes for political commentary now.  Coulter's work demonstrates exactly the potential danger for degrading society and disdain for thinking that people like Ms. Coulter piously/hypocritically rail against.  She will happily take the same formula to the bank time and again.  Why must political discussion turn to childish name calling in order to convince self-selected audiences of something they already want to believe.   Pitiful rants here.  If you are in it for fun or don't care that you are getting a skewed, sensationalist opinion, maybe you should read a few paragraphs of this in the book store.  But for something better, why not go for an intelligent book that takes an even handed, analytical approach, rather than buy into the opinions of a new breed of political analyst (on both right and left) that race to produce the most extreme charactures of any political philosophy they do not happen to agree with.  
books||2.0||"The Glorious Cause" is the sequel to "Rise to Rebellion," and since the first novel was so good I eagerly dove into this one, but was disappointed to find it had nowhere near the same depth and quality of characterization. On a scale of 1 to 10, I give it a 4, as compared to the 8 I would give "Rise to Rebellion."The events recounted in "Rise to Rebellion" involving the lead up to the Revolutionary War seemed so much more detailed and interesting, with a vast array of characters that were so colorful; John Adams, Paul Revere, Samuel Adams, Ben Franklin, and others. "The Glorious Cause" was not without its merits, but it seemed so much drier and less appealing, with a more narrow focus. It was far too long in some parts, to the point my attention wandered, and getting through it was a chore in some sections, unlike the preceding novel which seemed to turn its own pages. I listened to this book on audio tape during my commute, and often found myself impatiently trying to keep my focus upon the narrative while controlling my urge to fast forward to a livelier scene.One element I felt truly slighted by was the coverage of Benedict Arnold and his defection to the British cause. I assumed this would be one of the lengthier and more rewarding sections of the book, but it zipped by fairly rapidly with little genuine immersion into the subject material.A mark of a good book is how I feel when I have finished reading it - if I am disappointed I have reached the end of the story, then I know it was time well spent. Getting to the end of "The Glorious Cause" felt more like finishing some particularly grueling outdoor project; it was uncomfortable work, and now that I'm done I feel I can do something a bit more interesting. Because Shaara did such a good job with "Rise to Rebellion" I don't feel my lack of appeal for this book is his responsibility; perhaps the subject matter didn't complement my taste as well. I prefer interesting historial detail over tepid, droning battle descriptions, and I feel the differences between those two categories represent perfectly the differences between "Rise to Rebellion" and "The Glorious Cause.

books||2.0||Mark Twain once said that (and I paraphrase)the definition of a classic is something that everyone wants to have read and no one wants to read. That is my experience with this book. For some reason, A Tale of Two Cities never made it onto any of my high school reading lists, and I figured it was one of those books I should have under my belt. So I picked it up. What a slog! A book that might have been fascinating due to its French Revolution subject matter was a mass of rambling descriptions and melodrama. We were supposed to shed tears for Sidney Carton, a character who you barely get to know, and root for Lucie Manette...the highly unrealistic paragon of unspoiled goodness. The only thing I liked about this book was how Madame Defarge knitted a list of people on which she planned to take revenge. An admittedly cool concept. Maybe this book speaks to another era, maybe it's past its prime, maybe I don't have the required literary sensibilities, or maybe I couldn't relate, but A Tale of Two Cities bored me to tears.
books||5.0||This is a great book for those who have interest in modern economics.

books||1.0||First, I am a very open-minded person, raised by a hippy/Biker family.  I really expected to identify with this book.  While I appreciate the what Ina May's movement accomplished during its time, I felt like the book was almost a joke--verging more on detailing accounts of an occult community--A community of people living on old school buses in the woods, delivering each other's babies.The language is terrible---everything is described as "psychedelic," etc--one woman even referred to her female parts using the big "p" word.  While they try to add a personal touch by including individual narrations, it sounds more like a compilation of uneducated people describing their birth stories the way they were pressured to believe---NOBODY mentions feeling pain during labor. Honestly, I feel that the pressure of the community was so intense they wouldn't have admitted to pain if they could.Also, many of the accounts were extremely erotic---couple are encouraged to fondle one another during labor to keep connected and relaxed.  In some accounts, a couple would be making out, while a midwife would massage the birthing mother in her "laboring parts"--turning the woman on and keeping her relaxed.  Not my cup of tea.I had so little respect for the lifestyle and the language of the people that I didn't get much out of the book

books||1.0||John Katzenbach is an accomplished author and I had previously read and enjoyed another of his novels (The Analyst), so I was surprised at how bad The Shadow Man was.  The premise of the plot is that four very old Jewish people, survivors of the Holecaust, believe they have seen the "Shadow Man".  The Shadow Man was a Jew who joined forces with the Nazis to find Jews that were hiding to avoid certain doom in concentration camps.  These four old people feared the Shadow Man more than anything.  When one of them is killed, a retired police detective named Simon Winter looks into who the Shadow Man is.  Meanwhile, the Miami police are also investigating the death of the elderly Jewish woman and have young gangster as a suspect.Eventually, Winter and the police and the District Attourney join to hunt the Shadow Man, a man of pure evil.  As the book villian, it was hard to fear a villian who was a killer 50 years ago but was now in his 70s.  Also, this book barely touches on WWII, yet purports at times to be a novel about WWII.  I've read a lot of great WWII novels, and this book would have been great if it had been set in the 60s.  But setting it present day with senior citizens and the main characters wasn't too exciting.  It wasn't exciting primarily because I wondered where had the Shadow Man been all these years?  Why was he starting to kill now?  The Shadow Man had no motivation to kill.Finally, I realized I didn't like this book when I was skipping paragraphs at a time during the last 20 pages.  The entire book was like this with each character prone to long rambling inner thoughts that really added nothing to the story.  If you take away the WWII angle, this novel is bad.  The WWII angle adds some excitement, but there are probably thousands of books out there that relate the horror of WWII better than this one does.The review from Publishers Weekly printed above summarizes my thoughts and deserves to be repeated..."Katzenbach (Just Cause) has some good Holocaust and WWII vignettes and pretty good cop-talk here, but the book is burdened by flat characterization, a slow pace, an odd, unsatisfying ending and a serious need for editing.

books||5.0||Trotsky once wrote that of the three great tragedies in life- hunger, sex and death- revolutionary Marxism, which was the driving force behind his life and work, mainly concerned itself with the struggle against hunger. That observation contains an essential truth about the central thrust of the Marxist tradition. However, as Trotsky demonstrates here, Marxist methodology cannot and should not be reduced to an analysis of and prescription for that single struggle. Here Trotsky takes on an aspect of the struggle for mass cultural development.In a healthy post-capitalist society mass cultural development would be greatly expanded and encouraged. If the task of socialism were merely to vastly expand economic equality, in a sense, it would be a relativity simple task for a healthy socialist society in concert with other like-minded societies to provide general economic equality with a little tweaking after vanquishing the capitalism mode of production. What Marxism aimed for, and Trotsky defends here, is a prospect that with the end of class society and economic and social injustice the capacity of individual human beings to reach new heights of intellectual and creative development would flourish. That is the thought that underpins Trotsky's work here as he analyzes various trends in Russian literature in the immediate aftermath of the October Revolution of 1917. In short, Marxism is certainly not a method to be followed in order to write great literature but it does allow one to set that literature in its social context and interrelatedness. You will find no Deconstructionist or other fashionable literary criticism here. Quite the contrary. Here Trotsky uses his finely tuned skill as a Marxist to great effect as he analyzes the various trends of literature as they were affected (or not affected) by the October Revolution and sniffs out what in false in some of the literary trends. Mainly at the time of writing the jury was still out about the prospects of many of these trends. He analyzes many of the trends that became important later in the century in world literature, like futurism and constructivism, and others- some of which have disappeared and some of which still survive. The most important and lasting polemic which Trotsky raised here, however, was the fight against the proponents of `proletarian culture'. The argument put forth by this trend maintained that since the Soviet Union was a workers state those who wrote about working class themes or were workers themselves should in the interest of cultural development be given special status and encouragement (read a monopoly on the literary front).  Trotsky makes short shrift of this argument by noting that, in theory at least as its turned out, the proletarian state was only a transitional state and therefore no lasting `proletarian culture' would have time to develop. Although history did not turn out to prove Trotsky correct the polemic is still relevant to any theory of mass cultural development.One of the results of the publication of this book is that many intellectuals, particularly Western intellectuals, based some of their sympathy for Trotsky the man and fallen hero on his literary analysis and his ability to write. This was particularly true during the 1930's here in America where those who were anti-Stalinist but were repelled by the vacuity of the Socialist Party were drawn to him. A few, like James T. Farrell (Studs Lonigan trilogy), did this mostly honorably. Most, like Dwight MacDonald and Sidney Hooks, etc. did not and simply used that temporary sympathy as a way station on their way to anti-Communism. Such is the nature of the political struggle.A note for the politically- inclined who read this book. Trotsky wrote this book in 1923-24 at the time of Lenin's death and later while the struggle for succession by Stalin, Zinoviev and Kamenev was in full swing. While Trotsky did not recognize it until later (nor did others, for that matter) this period represented the closing of the rising tide of the revolution. Hereafter, the people who ruled the Soviet Union, the purposes for which they ruled and the manner in which they ruled changed dramatically. In short, Thermidor in the classical French revolutionary expression was victorious. Given his political position why the hell was he writing a book on literary trends in post-revolutionary society at that time.       
books||4.0||Barrow, an astronomer at the University of Sussex when this book was published, provides an entertaining and informative account of the foundations and philosophy of mathematics.  Do mathematicians invent or discover mathematics?  What 'reality' do mathematical entities like pi have?  What accounts for what physicist Eugene Wigner has called, in a now-famous paper, "The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences" (299)?  After an interesting account of the history of counting and numbers, Barrow discusses in succeeding chapters the philosophies of formalism, inventionism, intuitionism, and platonism, a sophisticated version of which he seems to favor.  Perhaps most mathematical workers follow what Alfred Korzybski called "the 'christian science' school of mathematics, which proceeds by faith and disregards entirely any problems of the epistemological foundations of its supposed `scientific' activities" (Science and Sanity 748).  I commend Barrow because he considers these epistemological questions important and writes about them so engagingly.  Barrow's discussions of theories and personalities provide useful background for understanding mathematical foundations.  As for Barrow's conclusions, from a non-aristotelian view, the appeal of platonism seems understandable as an example of identification, the confusion of orders of abstracting.  Barrow doesn't seem to consider that mathematicians may both invent and discover mathematics.  He seems so taken with the effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences that the notion of mathematical entities existing solely as high-order abstractions in human nervous systems seems insufficient to him.  As Korzybski pointed out, we live in a world of multi-dimensional, ordered structures or relations.  It does not seem unreasonable, then, that we can map this world with an exact language of relations, i.e., mathematics.  But as Korzybski also pointed out many times, "the map is not the territory."
books||4.0||I have long been aware of the commercial success of author Nora Roberts but the storylines and writing style (a genre often characterized as romantic suspense with apparent emphasis on the romance) have never tempted me to read any of her work. However, I happened to pick up a copy of volume #21 (depending on how you count anthology inclusions) in the .... IN DEATH series written under the pen name J.D. Robb and was immediately intrigued by its premise of a futuristic police procedural series (the year is 2058) with a strong central character (Detective Lieutenant Eve Dallas) who had a continuing romantic interest (the mysterious Irish billionaire Roarke). I have long enjoyed the Spenser series by Robert Parker and the ensemble cast of Ed McBain's 87th Precinct novels; the reward of finding another such series to enjoy would only be increased by some speculation thrown into the mix regarding the future direction of science in the aid of police work as well as speculation concerning the evolution of New York City, an area very familiar to me. I was immediately hooked by SURVIVOR IN DEATH and despite some minor criticisms gave it a five star review (3/30/2005). I read ORIGIN IN DEATH, the next book in the series, as soon as it was released and also enjoyed it sufficiently to rate it five stars as well (7/26/2005). As with other series which I have enjoyed, I then decided to read some of the earlier books to fill in the backstory and see how the characters have evolved. In my opinion, the early stories in the series can best be labeled transition novels as romance author Roberts attempts to transform herself into mystery writer Robb. My recent three star review (11/29/2005) of NAKED IN DEATH, the initial book in the series, discusses the specific positives and negatives of that attempt, so I will not go into detail again here. And in summary, I found this book a much better police procedural although with the major flaw that it seemed a little too obvious that Eve's pursuit of her initial suspect (although logical) would turn out to be a diversion from her identification of the real killer. I so greatly enjoyed Susan Ericksen's audio rendition (unabridged CD) of that book that I also chose to listen to the audio version of this novel; I highly recommend her narration as likely to add to your enjoyment of the story. A wonderfully apt Dryden quotation concerning fame and death opens this story; then Lt. Eve Dallas is discovered at the scene of a shocking homicide. Prosecuting Attorney Cicely Towers, a powerful and widely recognized star in the District attorney's office and a woman with whom Eve has dealt on occasion, has been found with her throat brutally slashed in a nasty neighborhood far from her office and her home late one night. The final appointment in her datebook is for an earlier dinner with her good friend and long time lover George Hammett; Eve quickly establishes that she arrived safely home and subsequently received a mystery call of which she made no record but which obviously drew her to the scene of her death. Eve's investigation is complicated by the close friendship of Cicely's ex-husband Marco Angelini and their adult children (David and Marina) with her boss, Commander Whitney and his increasing concern as Eve's investigation concentrates on the family. Eve discovers that both David Angelini and Marina's fiance Randall Slade have financial problems which could provide a motive for murder; as additional damaging background information surfaces she appears to be on a collision course with Whitney's understandable concern both for these children who have suffered the tragic loss of their mother; in addition, the stress increases when it appears that the friendship Whitney's wife with the family may lead to her potential involvement as a material witness. Finally, a further complication which brings into question Dallas' objectivity is the revelation that the Angelini family, Cicely Towers and Eve's lover Roarke are are partners in a business venture.Additional murders soon occur which bear the signature trademark of the killer, and media pressure intensifies on Eve given the visible lack of progress in her investigation and the antipathy which she has evoked in C.J. Morse, who coanchors the evening news with her friend Nadine Furst. Eve is infuriated by C.J.'s actions and yet knows that in fact the only effective way to silence the slimeball's continual attempts to denigrate her investigatory skills during his broadcasts is identify and catch the murderer. Meanwhile, Eve is also involved in establishing the boundaries in her relationship with Roarke, both with regard to their personal lives and when his aid might be appropriate in her police investigation. After several twists, including one diversion which I had not anticipated, the story suddenly rockets towards a violent climax which it is not clear that all the central characters will survive.In addition to Roarke, Commander Whitney, Lt. Dallas, and reporter Nadine Furst, this story contains all the series characters introduced in the first volume including Dr. Mira and the unique irrepressible Mavis Freestone and Summerset, all of whom play relatively minor roles in this narrative. Finally, the reader is introduced to Patrol(wo)man Peabody, whose observational skills in her relatively minor role in this case commend her to Eve. She will eventually become both Eve's good friend and partner on subsequent cases and their complementary styles and skills will combine with their dedication to speaking for the dead and their loved ones will serve them well. If you plan to read several volumes of the series, I strongly suggest that you start with NAKED IN DEATH and then read this book even though they are inferior to the two later books which I have read. The later books include details concerning the mysteries of Roarke's and Dallas' childhood backgrounds and the impact on their individual lives which provide a context that I would have preferred to have gradually unfold as I completed the series in the sequence which the author intended. And certainly, if you want a romance/detective story then read NASKED IN DEATH. While this book still had some steamy sequences much more typical of Nora Robert's novels than the later stories in this sequence, they were much more infrequent and better integrated into the story. However, if you only plan to sample a few stories in the series, then I strongly suggest that you skip the early books and concentrate on some of the later novels, including either of the two which I mention at the beginning of this review. The characters and their relationships are much more developed as the series progresses and the plots are also more complex. Meanwhile, I plan to continue to pursue the dual goal of reading each of the new releases as they occur while gradually filling in my knowledge of Dallas' past cases.Tucker Anderse

dvd||5.0||Dustin Hoffman, arguably one of the most popular actors of the 1980s and 90s, is in top form here -- but this time as a woman.  Sure, there have been other films with similar setups -- "Victor/Victoria" with Julie Andrews and "Mrs. Doubtfire" with Robin Williams, to name just two.  Andrews, however, isn't believable as a man, and while Williams is exceptional in "Doubtfire," that movie seems to lose its "edge" near the end.  In "Tootsie," Jessica Lange, Teri Garr, and Dabney Coleman all provide laudable -- even outstanding -- performances.  Lange won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress, and Garr was nominated in that category.  Dustin Hoffman was nominated for Best Actor, Sidney Pollack for Best Director, and the film for Best Picture.  Why didn't it win any of those three?  One word -- "Gandhi."  Nevertheless, "Tootsie" looks as though it were fun to make, and it is certainly fun to watch.  This is an absolute must for Dustin Hoffman fans

dvd||4.0||"Fargo" is a very good film. The Cohen Brothers put another feather in their cap with this suspenseful film. The film stars Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy) as a car salesman in dire need of money. When he hires a couple of losers to kidnap his wife for ransom, things go from bad to worse. I couldn't help feeling sorry for the wife as she tries to escape from the clutches of her kidnappers. The father of the kidnapped wife does not want to play along with the ransom, and decides to act on his own. Jerry now finds himself in an even deeper mess. Moreover, he has a saavy police chief (McDormand) on the case. The film is a definite black-comedy, as many of the Cohen brother's films are. This one is a bit more disturbing than usual however. Hot on the case is a policewoman, Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand). She is witty and intelligent and knows something is not right. Steve Buscemi stars as one of the kidnappers, and his partner has a few loose marbles. The film is a delightful [at times funny] film that is highly recommended. Moreover, there are many colorful and funny character actors in the film, which only enhance the films appeal. There are also some disturbing scenes, however, the film is well worth the watch and purchase. Highly recommended. [Stars: 4.5

Woody Allen's character was completely freeky and there was not a single purpose for him being there. Come to think of it, THERE WAS NO PURPOSE FOR THIS MOVIE!!!!!! So save yourself and never watch this film
dvd||2.0||HART'S WAR had potential. The last months of World War Two as a backdrop with demoralized GI's crammed into an overcrowded POW compound.  If this picture was soley about the hardships endured by surrendered soldiers during the Battle of the Bulge, then it could have had a chance.  Instead the film makers took on too many plots and subplots.  Unintentionally the movie borrows from SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE, A SOLDIER'S STORY, THE GREAT ESCAPE and STALAG 17.  A cardinal rule in war films is that the premise has to be simple.  In HART'S WAR we find some good elements lost in a virtual Mulligan stew.  In the story Colin Farrell's character, a rear echelon lawyer, accompanies another officer on what he thinks is a joyride.  Unfortunately for Farrell, the Germans have launched their attack in the Ardennes. The young lawyer is captured, harshly interrogated, and finally shipped out to a German stalag.  There he meets the senior POW officer, played by Bruce Willis, and tries to settle down in the dirty and uncomfortable life of a POW.  A soldier is killed and a recently downed Tuskegee airman is accused of murder.  Yes, you guessed it.  Farrell takes on the aviator's defense during the subsequent courts martial.  If director Gregory Hoblit left the storyline to develop around the trial a decent film could have emerged.  Instead we have additions of Colonel Hart's unexplained behavior, an mass tunnel escape plot, sabotage and the German Commandant's attempt to befriend the American lawyer as superfluous baggage.HART'S WAR was filmed in the Czech Republic, no doubt to cut costs.   A little more effort and a lot less story and this film would have had a better showing at the box office.  Still, if you enjoy war movies you should probably add this DVD to your collection
dvd||5.0||This is a great video collection of her past videos. I love it. From the sweet 'I Wanna Love You Forever' to the record label controlled image of 'Irrisistible' and 'A Little Bit' I love the 'A Little Bit' video but that was the time when she was controlled by her label which made her album flop. But overall this dvd is awesome. I like the footage from the Dream Chaser tour and the biography stuff. This is the best dvd before Jennifer Lopez's The Reel Me.
dvd||5.0||When Daryl Deever (William Hurt) tells TV reporter Tony Sokolow (Sigourney Weaver) he knows more than he actually does about a murder in the building where he works as a janitor, he gets more than he bargained for. Deever is a good guy, smart enough but ambitious only on his own terms. He's sort of engaged to his best friend's sister, but he's had a crush on Sokolow for two years. When the man in the building gets his throat slit, Sokolow is one of the reporters on the scene. Deever sees a perfect chance to get to meet her, so he tells her he may know something. She goes after the story and he goes after her. Sokolow is not quite engaged to a dedicated, capable man known as Joseph (Christopher Plummer), who is good friends with Sokolow's parents. It becomes clear that her wealthy parents, their rich friends and Joseph are engaged in the shadowy business of buying illegal ways for Jews to escape from the Soviet Union and to journey to Israel. And it appears that the man killed may have had an involvement, too. Before long, the man's associates learn of Deever's gambit with Sokolow and go after them to find out who was behind the killing. More lethally, the real murderer learns of what Deever said to Sokolow and believes Deever might actually know something. He goes after Deever.This is a tight, well constructed murder mystery with two first-rate components. First is the romance which builds between the characters played by Hurt and Weaver. These two people are attractive and smart. Hurt, in particular, comes across as guileless but he's no one's patsy. The two are very likable. Second, the situation which develops poses some ethical questions. Grades of gray come into play; it wouldn't be accurate to say that the murderer is simply another bad guy.The movie also features some first-rate actors besides Hurt and Weaver. There's Christopher Plummer who, as usual, brings so much assurance and nuance to his role; James Woods as the best friend, always a little off balance; Pamela Reed as Woods' sister; her mutual declaration of non-love with Hurt is very funny and appealing; Steven Hill and Morgan Freeman as the two cops assigned to the case; Kenneth McMillan as Hurt's father, angry and vulnerable; and Irene Worth and Albert Paulsen as Weaver's parents, people who love her but, especially the mother, always put responsibilities and obligations into the love. They all are very good.I like this movie a lot. The DVD picture looks fine. There are no extras to speak of
dvd||2.0||ALl 4 movies in this set are dubbed in English.   I was horribly disappointed. Dont make the same mistake I did. Find the dubbed ones
dvd||1.0||Julia Roberts plays Ed Harris' young new wife. Susan Sarandon plays Harris' ex-wife. Ex-wife does not like new wife. New wife does not like ex-wife. Ex-wife's cutsey, but bratty kids make new wife's life a living hell. Ex-wife thinks new wife is a stupid bimbo. New wife thinks ex-wife is a nagging battle axe. New wife and ex-wife fight and yell at each other ad nauseum. How does the film solve this conflict? Ex-wife is diagnosed with terminal cancer -- everyone reconciles, ex-wife and new wife suddenly love each other, the end. This is one of the most cliched, saccharine, hackneyed and shamelessly manipulative pieces of garbage put out by Hollywood in the past decade. If you like Julia Roberts, Susan Sarandon or Ed Harris, please see Erin Brokovich, Dead Man Walking and The Right Stuff and run screaming from this nauseating cinematic catastrophe
dvd||5.0||I am very disappointed with this movie "The Philadelphia Experiment" that have no English subtitles, due to my deafness. I was planning to buy this DVD.I have seen it many times in late 1980s and have been waiting for the English subtitles since
dvd||5.0||Man,talk about your untypical,not your average,regular kung fu movie!!Steven Chow blew the audiences away with this super hit.For those who have'nt seen it yet,it's a treat you simply cannot miss.Excellent dvd for anyone to add to their collection of favorites
dvd||5.0||I've also reviewed the first two volumes but I honestly believe that Volume Three is the best.  I plan on getting them all and have the entire series for the first time in my life but, if I had to pick a single best volume, it would be this one.FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE has the most solid Cold War story of all the films and everyone is firing on all pistons.  Connery IS Bond in this one, making the character his own, and Robert Shaw and Lotte Lenya as the villians are among the best.ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE is George Lazenby's only film and it remains a controversial entry in the series.  Myself, I loved it.  Diana Rigg is awesome, the photography and editing are great, and the story feels like it has more meat on its bones than any other film.(These first two films probably come closest to the Ian Fleming novels).LIVE AND LET DIE is Moore's first appearance as Bond.  It has a hit Paul McCartney & Wings song and a 19-year-old Jane Seymour, along with a very charismatic villian in Yaphet Kotto.  The boat chase is still thrilling and Sheriff J.W. Pepper is still hilarious.GOLDENEYE is Brosnan's first appearance as Bond and remains his best film.  Wonderful use of Russian locales, particularly the "graveyard" of Communist statues, and the deadliest Bond girl since Pussy Galore.FOR YOUR EYES ONLY was an attempt to get back to better stories after the overblown epics of the Seventies.So, as far as I'm concerned, there isn't a bad one in the lot.  Like I said, I plan on getting them all--but this one looks like the best.Enjoy
dvd||5.0||The story of a young award winner of a filmmaker's competition going through the trials and tribulations of trying to get "his" first feature film made is given a wonderful treatment by Christopher(Spinal Tap)Guest. It's a cynical and hysterical look at how Hollywood is bent and how it can make anyone bend and eventually submit to its neurosis. Unlike many of favorable reviewers I'm not a fan of Christopher Guest's later works and that's not just because I'm envious of him being married to Jamie Leigh Curtis(lucky dog). I don't find Guffman or Best of Show more than mildly amusing at best. Save for Bob Balaban in Guffman(When Sparky comes back, I almost bust a gut). Sometimes artists do their best work up front. I like Woody Allen's first three pictures the best(What's Up Tiger Lily, Take the Money and Run, Bananas). I think this is the case here. Guest hit gold. Great script, terrific performances by an incredible ensemble cast. A near genius(I'm gonna steal one of the other reviewer's word here because it's so perfect, kudos and thanks) "turn" by JT Walsh delivering two of the greatest non sequiturs in film history(alas, another "great" dying so soon before his time like Warren Oates and Robert Shaw). Fabulous work by Martin Short, Teri Hatcher, J,T, Walsh, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Fran Drescher, Dan Schneider, Jason Gould, Wakter Olkewicz and seriously I could keep writing names for another 5 or 6 lines. There are tons of people in this sublime comedy. Its only drawbacks are that it has the misgivings of be made in the Eighties with all its trappings and a rather sloppy reunion scene(Bacon/McKean)that comes off as way too cloying. Other than that this is a rare comic treat for anyone who can see the cynical side of Hollywood. Someone said comparing this to The Player was like comparing Bagger Vance to Caddyshack. I'm not quite sure which one is suppose to be good and which is suppose to be sub-par. Caddyshack is a classic and so The Big Picture. I am a big, big fan of Altman and The Big Picture is even par with The Player. If either were more biting I would give the nod to The Big Picture. Though, Richard E Grant's performance is almost as good as Walsh's.Nick's(Kevin Bacon)flights of fancy are hysterical. This is an inspired and unfortunately one-of-a-kind comedy.
dvd||5.0||Great movie! Make it part of your collection. Good story, beautiful video and great sound. Turn your volume up on the blast-off and you will feel the power!
dvd||2.0||In essence, this is a Texas Chainsaw remake, but here's the difference, and why it's far inferior. I don't care one iota for the "victims." I can barely tell the females apart. The guys are so obnoxious, I look forward to them dying. Unlike Texas Chainsaw (parts one and two, horror masterpieces!), this movie shows the "psycho family" (hmmm... kind of like Texas Chainsaw?) far too much. A little goes a long way, too much? OVERKILL! Many plot holes, and take away the music, there was some really bad acting. It gets two stars for the cool middle inserts in funky film style, and also the one great sequence where the cops are killed. But in general, Rob Zombie should not get writing credit for this. It's Texas Chainsaw Massacre, only nowhere near as good
dvd||1.0||The year: 1965. The cast: Peter Sellers. Peter O'Toole. Woody Allen. Ursula Andress. The soundtrack: Burt Bacharach. Tom Jones. Dionne Warwick. Manfred Mann. The movie: Believe it or not -- terrible. Really... as in unwatchable (other than the relatively entertaining animated opening credits.) Painfully unfunny slapstick routines, actors seemingly reading their lines off of cue cards, and no plot to speak of. Not even fun to watch for 60's camp value like The Party or Casino Royale... I had to turn it off at about the halfway mark.Grade: IncompleteSafest bet: Get the soundtrack, skip the movie...
dvd||4.0||Good introduction to Qigong.  Mirror image instruction would have been helpful for some of the more complex moves and even some moves with back to the camera would have been helpful.  Overall relaxing and precise. 
dvd||2.0||The basic premise of this movie could be quite interesting - how does a man trained as a 'killing-machine' integrate back into society.  Yes, it's been done before but still holds promise.  The plot was adequate.The acting was believable - no complaints there.  I particularly enjoyed Sean Pertwee as 'Mace'.  And Jason Isaacs has long been a favorite actor.But what ruined the movie for me was the science.  I'm not a fanatic - I have no problems with FTL travel or spaceships 'banking' on turns or loud explosions in space in movies.  And I realize that movies are not 'real'.  But I've never seen more 'bad' science in any one movie.  My son and I watched this together and it turned into a contest seeing who could catch more bloopers.  I could go on and on detailing the scientific and logic errors in this movie - but it would take me all night.  It spoiled the whole movie for me
dvd||1.0||This is the WORST transfer of a movie (that is not a tape-to-tape before DVD bootleg) that I have ever seen.  Many scenes in the daylight show a jiggling reflected lights, or so it appears, and lines dance around with the sound.  It was so bad I thought it was in individual damaged DVD, until I read other reviews here and on IMDB.This is far worse than most cheapie transfers that are no longer owned but are in the public domain.  At least in those instances they usually have the excuse that the print they are working from is old and worn.  I have a much better video of Exodus on VHS tape in EP!And this movie is currently being offered at Amazon for $14.95.  Don't bother!  Tape it off TCM and you'll have a far higher quality visual record.As for the movie itself, despite good actors and one of the most wonderful music scores, it's very flat.  Kirk Douglas would have been a far better choice than Newman, who acts like he just came off a binge after a losing pool streak.  Nonetheless, it should not be sold with in lousy visual copies
dvd||1.0||Our family has an embarassingly large collection of Elmo and Sesame Street DVDs, so I speak from experience... I found this production to be way below par. My 2 1/2 year old son picked it out at the video store and we got through maybe :10 minutes before he volunteered to turn it off and do Play-Doh instead. The plot if poorly contrived, the production value is low, the acting for the most part is awful, and it's basically just a way to stitch together a series of music videos which at his age, my son has no interest in. He did like the part where the muppets try to break open the dressing room with a jack hammer. But I'm not buying the video for a 12 second clip. Better bets: A Celebration of Me, Grover or Sesame Street: The Street We Live On
dvd||1.0||HELLO?????Whoever mastered this great film RUINED it by FORGETTING or REFUSING to provide English subtitles for the Japanese and Italian characters.  How can such a thing happen?  If you find the VHS buy it.  Maybe some day someone will make the corrections.  Until then, AVOID this DVD
dvd||2.0||Ok,  I'll addmit this had some pretty stunning moments here and there but other than that this was a yawn.  This film is trying to jump on the japanese horror bandwagon.  It really doesn't take a genius to figure out this plot.  I mean as soon as the main actress enterred the cabin and heard her husband in the next room I turned to my girlfreind and told her the whole film's plot and sure enough I was right on the money, only I thought it would of ended 20 minutes earlier but oh no, it had to keep going and going...just end allready, I get it!
dvd||1.0||Dull, dull, dull.If I could have submitted a review and given ZERO stars I would have.Pointless
dvd||1.0||I never saw the series on tv so when it came out on dvd, I was excited, remembering the magazine from when I was a kid and being a fan of ILC, SNL, and comedy itself.  I am also known for finding various comic styles funny where others don't.  I write this review now as I am TRYING to watch the third disc.  I got the dvd the first day it came out and I have to watch every dvd I get, even if I saw it before.  Regardless to say, I only broke a smurk ONCE throughout the first 2 1/2 discs.  I even tried watching parts of the disc when I was having a great day and even when I was not in the greatest of moods.  I was in a good mood again this morning so I started watching it.  I think it is the lamest show that I have ever seen.  I really don't know why it ever lasted past the first season.  If you've seen the show on tv and you like it, more power to you, if you haven't seen it, don't buy it, it is a waste of money.  Everybody says that after season two is when it gets funny...  I personaly don't think I should have to endure a whole first season for it to get funny
dvd||5.0||A film about the porn industry in the late 70's early 80's. Great Cast, Great Performances, Great Story, just a Great Film. Unique approach to the subject, characters that are flashy yet human with real emotion ,characters played by Julianne Moore, Don Cheadle, Heather Graham, William H. Macy, and Burt Reynolds respectfully, are great to watch. This is a performance piece
dvd||1.0||Watching this movie, I am struck by how effectively they can take one of the most interesting and exciting stories possible, and make it drag out on the screen.  The disappointment at the pacing of such great subject matter holds no bounds.  Watching this moving is almost embarassing knowing how good this could and should be, and how poor direction, and what seems like a script which does injustice to pacing and drama can wreck what should be greatness.  I won't even go into historical inaccuracies, or the completely ridiculous cover art showing a modern beretta as the pistol sidearm 40 years too early.  Makes me wonder if this movie was crafted with apathy towards the subject, the audience and history instead of respect
dvd||1.0||After I read Erik Larson's wonderful book "The Devil in the White City" I was fascinated by the brief glimpses at Holmes' story. But this documentary was a phenomenal disappointment. The production is amateurish at best, complete with needlessly corny reenactments worthy of "Mondo Carne." With such a wealth of fascinating information available (court transcripts, etc) do we really need filler footage of some faceless actress wandering down dark hallways acting frightened? This man killed countless people and yet the producers of this documentary thought so little of their audience that they hired a narrator who sounds as if he is the chief ride operator of the Haunted Mansion at Disneyland. Truly disappointing. Perhaps someone will make an interesting documentary of Holmes. This most certainly isn't it
dvd||4.0||I'm a big Survivor fan; and as such, I love any of the DVD complete season packets of Survivor.  It's great because if you happened to miss one of the episodes for whatever reason, you get to see the challenges and how and why the person got voted off the island.  I did not however give this 5 stars, because I also own the Survivor All-Stars DVD pack, so I know that they could have done more with the Palau pack.  In the All-Stars pack you get to see A LOT more speacial features of things occured on the island but never made it into the broadcast.  Some of these outakes give a lot of insite into camp life and the characters, which is always fun.  But other than missing those features, the Survivor Palau pack is well worth seeing
dvd||5.0||Ok, I understand the male and female symbols used on the movie logo.Those represent the male and female viewpoints of the main two characters.They are the traditional "Mars" and "Venus" symbols representing masculinity and femininity. I also understand the last symbol representing "infinity", a never-ending loop symbolizing an ideal marriage that will last forever. Or maybe the propagation of "eternal life" by the offspring of the parents carrying on their genes into eternity. But what is to be made of the star and dagger symbol??? Are these symbols somehow representing a conflict of religious values?(The Star of David representing Judaism and a cross representing Christianity)I haven't seen the movie in years but I don't remember a conflict in religious beliefs being part of the plot.Please also forward your thoughts to VBoston at aol.com. 
dvd||1.0||i practically fell asleep while watching this tape, the girl doing the exercises isn't even saying anything while she's doing it. It's a voice over! also she's all alone in a blank room. All the exercises are basically the same. I would suggest Mtv Pilates. It's a lot more fun
dvd||4.0||A hilarious movie, made moreso by the fact that the acting and plot are universally better than what you'd find in the object of it's spoofing, "Top Gun." The film is loaded with Abrahams's usual sight-gags, puns, slapstick, and quick wordplay. There's always something going on in the background, making for fun repeat viewings. The overall cheesiness of the special effects really adds to the overall experience. Besides that, it's educational, too! You'll never again wonder what a chafing dish is
dvd||2.0||Kelly Preston and Tcheky Karyo are a New York City couple who come together after Preston leaves Matthew Broderick and Karyo uses Meg Ryan in order to get a Visa. Now Broderick and Ryan are teaming up to get even with their ex's. The problem is, the offenses they've endured (being dumped and being used) don't really warrant the horrible things they do to these two people, especially Karyo. Which is probably why first-time director Griffin Dunne used two such amiable stars in the feature roles. After all, how can we not root for Ferris Bueller and Harry's Sally? Unfortunately, it ends up being pretty easy not to root for them when their revenge is so excessive, the pace of the film is so uneven, and the script isn't particularly funny. There's a difference between black comedy and just mean-spirited comedy. Despite a handful of amusing moments and a few nice cinematic touches, this film does not walk that line very well
dvd||5.0||Seriously! At the end of Fat Eliminator Minna says "do this program on a regular basis and watch your body change". It's true. I have been doing this DVD and only this DVD for about a month now - 3 days a week is Fat Eliminator and 2 days is Strength and Grace and my body is firm! I have abs now, biceps and definition in my thighs and buns. Extra flab is gone. This is a fantastic workout combination. FE is tough, particularly the first three cardio circuits. Those plyo jumping jacks are killer. Once I get through that third cardio circuit though I feel like I've already had a good workout and I'm only halfway through! I work up a sweat - I can't even answer the phone because I couldn't talk even if I wanted to. It's definitely focused on your lower body with lots of jumping and plyo and core work but the circuits are quick and they really do go by quickly. The workout is also fantastic in that just when you feel like you can't do one more plyo lunge, she changes the pace to something more less impact. The 15 minute Blast The Fat toning section I always add onto the cardio days. It's nice, quick and effective and in one hour while my son is napping I get in a total body workout.I also LOVE the Strength and Grace segment. I enjoy alternating my days with this. It's a perfect combination of relaxing and energizing and I still work hard, just without all the jumping around. My heart rate does get up there and again you do a lot of leg work for those nice glutes and thighs. Minna is a beautiful woman and I appreciate her demeanor and her physique. There is just something about her that is completely likable. Overall, I am extremely impressed with these workouts - the results I have seen will defintely make me continue these workouts
dvd||1.0||I generally like some of these French-comic-books-turned-into-movies because they're usually pretty erotic.  Jane Fonda's role in Barbarella comes to mind.  This Gwendoline series definitely had the POTENTIAL what with the scantily-clad women-in-bondage theme and the scenes involving Gwendoline with her dominant girlfriend.But the very beautiful Tawney Kitaen (cast as Gwendoline) apparently balked at doing girl/girl scenes (this was 1984, after all), and so the producers obligingly didn't force her to do any, and as a result this one turned into a very bland, weak, and diluted version of Raiders of the Lost Ark.  It's not a good adventure film, and it's certainly not erotic.There's a little nudity, and some ridiculous moments that are supposed to capture the kinkiness of the French comics, but overall this one was a disappointing bust.   
dvd||5.0||My 3 year old son loved this movie.  He sat in front of the tv with his model blue angel and mimicked every move the planes made in the video.  It was fun to watch my son and husband watch this video together, they both had big smiles on their faces.  The pilots in this video send a wonderful message to young children with dreams.  My 3 year old says "when I get big I am going to fly blue angel #5".  I highly reccomend this video
dvd||5.0||I was happy to see a 'romantic comedy' that didn't line up with every other formula picture in the genre.  Really fun stuff and some solid acting
dvd||5.0||The great thing about the Naruto series is it has an involved, ongoing storyline without taking itself too seriously. The episodes are well translated and the actors well chosen. It has some suspense and alot of comedy and for older children it has a nice message of never giving up on your dreams.My small gripes are that for some reason Naruto has the catch phrase of "Believe it!", and it gets dropped into places that it doesn't make any sense, but it's a small problem.Also the extras you get are really fun and high quality. This is a great package for the hardcore fan and newcomer alike
dvd||5.0||This movie I consider to be akin to 'Vertigo' by Alfred Hitchcock. The pace is a little on the slow side with a lot of non-verbal action pulling the story along. It also mimics 'Rear Window' in that the main character witnesses a murder. In this case though, he was set up to be the witness. DePalma seems to have taken these themes and added some very strong satire.He slams the porn industry in some very funny ways. You will have to watch and giggle along with some of these unforgetable scenes.What I liked mostly about this movie was that it kept you guessing until the end. I don't want to give away too much here, but a clever use of 'Hollywood Hijinks' and the line 'Don't believe everything you see' fit with the story very well.'Postcards from the edge' was the only strong movie that showed just how deceptive hollywood can be. In this film, DePalma shows how deadly and confusing it can be.As in 'Dressed to Kill', DePalma relies on non-verbal acting to carry the story, and quite successfully too. The scene begins when Craig Wasson leaves the house he is sitting to follow who he thinks he's been watching though a telescope. The scene is carried through a mall and then to a beach. I believe it's about 20 minutes. Played out well with body language and facial expressions, this scene couldn't work any other way.Like 'Vertigo', this movie seems to be drawn out somewhat. Maybe too much detail, not sure. I found myself becoming a little impatient at times for the story to continue.Not many movies attempt this slower approach, or do it in a way that makes it work.All in all, definitely a must see. Keep in mind, the action is a bit slow at times.Melanie Griffith appears here and does a great job in her role, as do the other actors. Filming, camera angels and use of props all work well. The plot is complex. This is a must see for suspense/murder mystery fans
dvd||1.0||The reason the original "Iron Chef" was such an awesome show was entirely due to the bad translation and over the top voice acting.  Therefore, without these elements, it becomes a pathetic charade of the original program.  I was, at one time, a hardcore cult fan of "Iron Chef" because of the hilarious voice overs and true, foreign zest of Chairman Kaga and the gang.  I really didn't care much for the cooking or whatever food was being prepared.  The real heart of the show was the voiceovers and the mad, zesty zeal with which the Japanese chefs went over something as inane as cooking.  I loved "Iron Chef" in much the same way as I loved the original "Mystery Science Theater 3000."  They were both quirky tv cult shows that gave a certain sense of community among their hardcore fans.  This new show really doesn't cut it in any way, shape, or form.  I'm not being unpatriotic or anything, I'm just saying why this new show is so weak.  Also, I noticed that once the translators of the original show started figuring out the show was a huge hit, they ruined their own voiceacting by being all self concious.  The original few seasons of the first "Iron Chef" are where it's at!  Once again, I don't watch this show for the cooking, I watch it for the odd, bizarre translations and cheesy voiceacting
dvd||1.0||     This movie was so horrible I don't know where to start. Maybe I could start with the fact the actors were so horrible it was as if the director picked them randomly off the street. Or maybe he just casted his own family...at any rate they were untrained and stale. Secondly, I had a serious issue with this movie not following basic christian principles. If Tyler Perry manages to tone down the swearing in his semi-christian plays, why wouldn't this movie director have enough sense to follow suit...If you're trying to actually sale to a christian audience. Furthermore, I thought the bible said a little something against divorce; like it wasn't permitted unless your spouse commits adultery/fornication. This movie seems to say it's okay to go against the word of God if you're in love. In fact, christianity was more of a theory in this movie than it was a practice....by even the protagonist! I laugh as I think of the scene where Ce-Ce Peniston's character says seductively, "I'm looking for a man with his mind on Jesus" Yet she's dressed like a hooker. Speaking of clothing, why did Ce-Ce seem to change outfits even in the middle of scene. They go on a date and she's dressed one way, by the time they come home she has on something different; with no logical explanation. And please explain why they had someone's grandfather playing the role of Rico Suave. Maybe the movie would have actually been worth while had he looked more like the man of any woman's dream. I felt more like telling him about AARP than I did falling in love with him. In addition, the soundtrack, IT-WAS-JUST-ANNOYING. At some parts it was even hard to hear what the characters were saying because of the music. I just wanted the maddness to stop! Lastly, It seems as if the director tried to portray single church women as being overwhelmingly desperate (although some are) However, having pamela fall so quickly for bryant was just, well, almost juvenile...perhaps even a disrespect to women at large. Overall, this movie made me want to puke. PASTOR Larry "Flash" Jenkins really needs to get some true insight on the conditions of the church and maybe even go back and read the bible for himself for clarity
dvd||5.0||Warning: Do not watch this movie if you are hungry! If you do, within the first 10 minutes, you will pause it, and have to run out for chinese food instantly and not the quick take out junk either, but the honest to god traditional chinese cuisine that the father makes. I adore this movie, It is a heartwarming, hilarious story about a Widower Retired Master Chef and his Three very different daughters. Ang Lee gives us insight into this family from the perspective of how love and life and humanity can be compared to eating and drinking. The soundtrack is amazing, the scenery is magnificent and the realness of it all transport you in, so that you can almost smell the food cooking. I would have killed to be on that set to just sample all those dishes!
dvd||5.0||I'm the biggest "Wuthering Heights" fan I know (ask anyone who knows me, and they'll tell you I borderline annoying with the subject). Having money left over from my birthday, I decided "Hey, why not buy yet another Wuthering Heights DVD?". I was a little skeptical about how it would be, seeing as all the adaptations I've seen thus far haven't really taken the whole story into account. Of course, to do so would be a hard task for a movie. The story is complex and not a very average-movie-goer sort of plot. I was disappointed in the 1992 version with Juliette Binoche and Ralph Fiennes, although it's a good enough movie (as long as it didn't have Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights as the title...). Other versions were all right, and although the 1939 version didn't showcase the second generation of the story, I found it better than '92. Needless to say, when I popped in the DVD, I was hooked by the first five minutes. Sure, the movie isn't EXACTLY like the story (I want you to show me a movie that is. And, as I said, this story is complex for the movies). Some of the things that are different/changed/added/etc., are the fact that, once again (as in many of the movie adaptations) Nelly is old from the start. Also, Heathcliff and Cathy are older than when most of the scenes in the story take place (such as when they visit the Lintons). Most "Wuthering Heights" fanatics know that Heathcliff and Cathy never consemate their relationship. However, there's many a kiss in the movie. There are some other details of the movie that are different than the story, but I, a crazy "Wuthering Heights" and Bronte admirer, give this movie a bravo and would recommend to any other fan
dvd||5.0||I have found Pick Your Spot Pilates to be absolutely perfect!  I can choose which spot I want to work-out for the day or do them all.  I usually walk first then add a 10 minute Pilate workout to wrap it up while my muscles are still warm.  I would highly recommend this workout video
dvd||2.0||This really isnt a bad movie if you havent read the book, if you have read the book then think of this as another story based on the same subject. i understand that a book to movie will leave certain things out, and i accept that, but to completely change the ending is not excusable. What was wrong with the way the book ended? Like i said if you havent read the book you will like this movie although they do solve these very complex puzzles after a glance at them(even though they hide a very very valuable secret that will change the world). If you havent read the book or seen the movie do yourself a favor and pick up a copy, its a better story and its cheaper if bought in the paperback, if you dont have time to read it then get it on audio disk or tape
dvd||5.0||R.J. The Raccoon (Bruce Willis) was just looking for something to eat as he stumbles into his bear friend's (Nick Nolte) cave and accidently destroys his food, he has an entire week to find almost every scrap of food for him or else he dies. He finds a family of animals (Gary Shandling, William Shatner, Wanda Sykes, Steve Carrell, Eugene Levy, Catherine O'Hara, Avril Lavigne) and uses them for his scheme to go over the large hedge near their territory to the suburbs where they steal food from the humans. Later on, the home-owner Gladys (Allison Janey) hires professional exterminator Dwayne (Thomas Hayden Church) to kill them but can RJ save his own life or his new friends's?Extremely entertaining and fantastic CGI animated comedy from the makers of "Shrek 1 & 2", "Antz" and "Madagscar" Dreamworks provides great realistic CGI and laughs for everybody. There's also heart in this movie and shows the meaning of what it is like to have friends and be one's true self instead of being selfish! Steve Carrell's character Hammy the Squirrel steals the show here as the best character in the movie, it's a wonderful and hilarious movie that can be enjoyed by both kids and adults.This DVD has some good extras like two sneek previews to "Shrek 3" and "Bee-Movie", audio commentary, behind-the-scenes featurette, VerneTech commercial, games, meet the cast featurette and gallery.Highly recommended! the best Dreamworks animated movie since "Shrek 1 & 2"
dvd||1.0||This DVD exposes the Ultimate Warrior as 25% postitive and 75% negative.I do believe that Jim Hellwig does suffer from narcissm in relation to his ongoing identity crisis.  Just another case of a wreslter who couldn't seperate himself from the character, and even still till this day as he is retired give speaches to colleges.  The only thing that bothers me is that Jim Hellwig wasn't involved in this dvd to give his perspective and opinions.  He was offered to participate and again offered to make his story heard before and after the fact.  Jim Hellwig declined, & used it as another opportunity to initiate a lawsuit.This guy did make an impact in the wrestling world, but it was too shortlived.  Fans can chalk it up as a cool memory, but unfortunately not one linked with any high level of respect like we can with Flair, Piper, Hogan, and the most respected of all The Undertaker
dvd||5.0||Having seen Stella's live show in Hollywood, I had a sneaking suspicion that I was going to love their Comedy Central show, and I was not disappointed.  These guys have mastered the art of genius-disguised-as-idiocy, and nearly every episode is hilarious from beginning to end.  I guess I'm not surprised it didn't last; this kind of humor isn't for everyone.  But come on...we are talking about a network whose supposed hits include Mind of Mencia and Blue Collar Comedy, both of which are among the worst dregs that the comedy world has to offer.  These guys have been making great comedy for a lot of years, and I hope to see them in another show or movie soon.  Until then, I'll be enjoying Stella on DVD
dvd||2.0||I was not into this movie at all.  My mother recommended it to me but it was lame all the way through.  A middle-aged man decides he wants to do something different with his life, so he takes a dance class.  Ofcourse there's a fine dance instructor, a crush is pursued, a wife gets jealous, hires a detective, and *gasp* his crush is found out.  The movie was too predictable and it just wasn't for me.  Not a bad movie, just not my cup of tea.  Richard Gere was cute as usual, which was the only thing that made me watch it to the end, besides wanting to know what a correct quick step looked like since "So You Think You Can Dance" never had contestants who mastered it
dvd||1.0||If you read between the lines on all these glowing reviews, you will find out that this is a ridiculous movie with some good (not great) acting.  Jessica Lange basically does an impression of Marilyn Monroe with a southern accent.  Well not all of the time, since her accent seems to come and go.  The amount of effort that you will spend trying to suspend your disbelief will negate any good qualities this movie has.  Skip it unless you really, really, really love Jessica Lange.By the way, if this movie is set in the early sixties, why does the daughter have a peace sign on her bedroom wall?  This is the same daughter that finds a grenade in a drawer and promptly pulls the pin and tosses it to her boyfriend! Puh-lease
dvd||1.0||Trying to make a film concerning Studio 54 for a mainstream audience is a really bad idea. It's just not possible to do it and actually stay truthful to the climate of that era. Gays had a lot more influence on that scene than the film lets on. From what I understand, the original director's cut was gutted by Miramax before the film was released it and it shows. Other than Mike Meyers portrayal of Steve Rubell, there's hardly a gay character in sight. There's some very good actors in the film and their talents are simply wasted. Thank goodness the good music helped me get through this drivel. Anyone with a taste for fine filmmaking need not bother with this cinematic mistake
dvd||1.0||This newborn care DVD is strictly for caring for a newborn infant, in other words, what you learn here won't apply after the first 3 or 4 weeks.  My biggest beef with this DVD is that it totally just skims over all the basics, such as how to breastfeed properly, how to bottlefeed properly, how to swaddle properly, how to calm a baby properly, etc.  All the stuff you want to know about looking after a newborn, each is given about 5 seconds of screen time.  Instead, the bulk of the program is wasted on things like "pre-birth preparation," which interestingly appears toward the end of the program, and how the mother should take care of herself.  These are important things to know, but not for a "ultimate baby care DVD."The DVD packaging is also very misleading.  It says "over an hour of hints"... but that includes 1 minute of copyright warning and another 30 seconds of "you should always consult your doctor" warning, plus a long end-of-program credit.  The actual content is about 55 minutes.I've seen this DVD and the "ABC of Newborn Baby Care" DVD and even though the latter is not great, it's better because it goes through the important topics step-by-step, and the nurse/midwife demonstrates the techniques clearly.  Between the two DVDs, I definitely recommend the latter.BTW, you can likely find this at your local library.  It's also available from Netflix.  It's just not worth the price of the DVD, not even 1/10 of the price
dvd||5.0||Capsule reviewer Sam Graham (above) is one king-sized jerk! Tears For Fears and Swing Out Sister are two of the best acts that came out of the '80s and they are still going strong today! The videos on this collection are some of the most obvious, but enjoyable nevertheless. It would be nice if Amazon would hire somebody  to write for them who at least had a little common sense when it comes to music, instead of some supposedly "hip" idiot
dvd||4.0||This movie still rocks after all these years since it first came out.  An excellent and energetic movie from the start. Plot is cutesy.  It serves as a vehicle for the wonderful selection of songs and dance sequences.  However, I think this version of the movie is missing a few scenes?  I would rate this movie version with 5 stars had it been unedited to me.If memory serves me, didn't Alex receive a letter from her friend, Hannah, when Alex discovered Hannah passed away?  Isn't there a reconnection at the end between Mickey and Alex's (girl)friend whom the latter was dating?  Wasn't there more of a story build-up between Alex and her boss?  If this version is cut in anyway, I prefer getting the complete and unedited version.  I find this version incomplete somehow.But Jennifer Beals looks terrific and one wonders why she didn't star in more movies for her generation

dvd||5.0||What more could a true Parrotthead ask for than Jimmy Buffett live at Wrigley Field?This two-disc DVD set captures the truly historic concert from Chicago. Jimmy and the band put on a great show. It makes you feel as though you were part of the show.The bonus coverage is not to be miseed. The time lapse of setting up the stage is fun to watch. And the Star-Spangled Banner performance rivals Jimi Hendrix.This is a must for any music lover, but the true Parrottheads will definitely need to add it to their collection
dvd||5.0||I found this DVD to be well produced and engaging to go along with the POWERFUL content.  Fantastic.  Loads of deleted scenes that are very worth watching
dvd||5.0||The stellar performances of Jason Alexander (Buzz) and John Glover (James/John) make this movie, providing the most humorous and touching moments in this film. The Swan Lake scene, while funny, is probably the most sad, as each character explains how he will pass on. Yet the most interesting character to me is Gregory, as he is the glue that holds this group of men together, generously offering his Victorian house for holiday vacations. It is he who starts the film with his narration, welcoming the viewer in as if we are a visitor to his home as well, and having the final narration during the Swan Lake scene. He is caretaker to his friends in life and in death, and the central character that the six others revolve around; it is befitting that he will be the last to go. Each character struggles with his own demons; we are privy to their personal pain, yet all manage to rise above their problems and find joy in life and with each other's companionship. Even the most detestable character, John, is not entirely unsympathetic.Yes, there's some stereotypical moments, but all in all, this is an enjoyable film, one that leaves an indelible impression
dvd||5.0||In this set of episodes, the Battle City is down to the wire. My favorite character, Marik(not Yami Marik) is the center of the events. Most of his character is known in this set. It seemed almost if Yugi was only a side-note for a while. Even though I dislike dub, this was still good enough for me. The scene when Marik talks to his brother for the last time (or so he thinks at that moment) is one of the most beautifully drawn of any anime I've seen. If only the voice actor sounded like Marik's age for once and kept the poignant music. And didn't use the gold stuff when someone's mind is snatched.(And also a shame is that the Ishtars won't appear for many episodes after this with such a simple exit...

dvd||1.0||im a huge fan of writer Sean Mcginly, his classics include Venomous starring Treat williams and Sonic Impact with Ice-T.  Mcginly's films are the topic of discussion at film schools all across the world, he is a renowned talent and i have to say that i was appalled when i saw his latest film Two Days.  i think he should stick to writing as the film was virtually without direction and the cast (which included hacks like Paul Rudd) was not in the same league as superstars Traci Bingham and Ice-T who have graced some of his previous work.  Please Sean, stick to doing what you know best and stay away from the intellectual stuff, leave that to idiots like Capra, Wenders, Scorcese etc.  They are not in your league.

dvd||4.0||Spider-Man 2 is better than the original Spider-Man. I feel I should get that out of the way first, since most sequels have a tough time topping the first one. However, I feel Spider-Man 2 is only better in the sense that if the same production staff remade Spider-Man, it should naturally be better. That's what this sequel feels like, a literal remake with some spiced up elements here and there. It's a good film, but it's not really the way I thought a sequel should be.Effects are even better than the first, and the tentacles of Doc Ock make for some truly spectacular battles, including a centerpiece on a runaway train. Tobey Maguire continues to give an excellent portrayal of Peter Parker, and has good chemistry with Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane. Alfred Molina has more to work with as Doc Ock than Dafoe did as the Goblin, and humanizes what was once a wacky villain. James Franco continues to develop Harry Osborn well, and the supporting cast like JK Simmons and Rosemary Harris fill out the high-caliber acting. But the script needs work. It uses one of the worst superhero cliches as the main plot, that of the hero calling it quits. It's never convincing, and the film drags as we wait for Peter to realize things we've known all along. Character relationships, though well-acted, don't seem to have progressed since the first movie. We're still treading the Peter/Mary Jane love triangle, just with a different third wheel. Harry still has his on/off friendship with Peter. There are nice plot twists that shake things up towards the end, but most of the film is wasted on the exact same angst from the first one. For a story supposedly set 3 years later, it might as well have been 3 days.  We get a dvd with good extras and audio/video presentation. I enjoy Spider-Man 2 on its own, and it's nice to have it in my dvd library, but as a sequel it's not fresh enough for me. Hopefully next year's Spider-Man 3 will fix that. 
dvd||1.0||This is NOT a collection of the superbowls, played from start to finish, as some of the reviewers would lead you to believe.  I got this for my father so he could watch the 49ers tromp all over the Broncos over and over again (since they certainly haven't been up to much lately!).  Unfortunately, all we got was a collection of highlights, with so many "up close and personal" shots, that it was almost nauseating to watch on a bigger screen TV.  An expensive disappointment, surely
dvd||1.0||Considering the sensational cast (Eli Wallach, Terrence Hill, Bud Spencer, Kevin McCarthy and Brock Peters), the Euro-western era it was made in and the locations where it was shot, Ace High is a major disappointment. The plot is uninvolving and incoherent, the cinematography is cramped and completely lacking in style, the music is weak during a time that spawned so many memorable soundtracks and the direction lacks any focus whatsoever. The editing looks like it was performed with a butcher's knife. After the first ten minutes, I knew I'd made a mistake buying it. A boring 120 minute piece of junk, Ace High is hopelessly outgunned by any number of great Italian westerns including Corbucci's The Mercenary or Parolini's Sabata series. Save your fistful of dollars for a better film
dvd||2.0||Sure, this movie is a classic. But is it any good? Frankly, I found it to be tedious in the extreme.It's certainly pleasant to look at. The sets are quite amazing, and the cinematography is absolutely beautiful.The story (as described in detail in many other reviews here) has potential as both a thriller and a thought-provoking essay (ultimately it is neither).The acting is top notch, as are all of the special effects. Those of us who cut our teeth using teletype machines always get a kick out of seeing them in all their anachronistic glory. In fact, all of the computer stuff is believable for the era and pleasantly nostalgic.But the whole thing never rises to its premise. Its "thriller" aspect is artificial and not tied to the central plot line, and entirely predictable from the moment our friend is handed THE ONLY KEY THAT CAN STOP THE NUKE! The resolution is an afterthought (a quick fix in the extreme), and barely even mentioned in about two lines of dialogue after the artificial danger is (narrowly, whew!) averted. The characters are thin at best, and stock at worst.This movie is really a slow survey of what people in the early 70s thought technology would be like in the mid 70s. Yawn. (I must laugh at the whole bell/paper bit. It means nothing to the plot, and is the ultimate contrivance.)If a deadly virus actually came back from space, there would certainly be action on many fronts, with plenty of interesting conflict to go around. Some people would try to understand it, others would want only to kill it. There's some potentially interesting tension right there. Some people would argue to keep the danger hidden from the public, others would want to warn them. Again, that could have been a good source of tension. Someone would surely have suspected that the military wanted to harness it as a biological weapon (mentioned in passing, but never developed), while others would try very hard to prevent that. More tension.I'm just saying that this movie is littered with missed opportunities for something more than the collection of boring experiments and pointlessly slow-moving scenes which it actually contains. This movie is the poster child for boring science fiction, and it would not have had to be that way.I haven't read the book, but I bet it's a lot better. At its core, this movie is a boring dud.
dvd||1.0||This movie was obviously made by Japanese fans of several American films.  It then tried to mix them all together in one film. The main ones are the Matrix, Reservoir Dogs, and Night of the Living Dead.  Especially the Matrix.We have several yakuza meeting at a specified location where they usually bury their victims, the location turns out to be a forest of reincarnation so their victims are coming back to life.Then it is a dead-come-back-to-life genre gore film heavy with feuding Yakuza elements.Our main character has the long black Matrix type coat and general emotionless demeanor.   The high-tech 360 camera movements of the Matrix are blatantly being imitated minus the high-tech aspect.  Instead it is obvious that the camera itself is being moved 360 around the action.I really hated the Matrix so a film mainly paying tribute to the Matrix already has a big strike against it.As for the other elements, they were all brought in awkwardly and it just seemed to constantly extend the story with another element of their favorite American movies that they wanted to include.The gore was mostly uncreative and uninteresting.Note that if you are looking for something different than typical American movies by checking out those wacky Japanese movies, you will not get it here
dvd||1.0||This experience was TOTALLY UNSATISFACTORY!!!  I received a notice that the product had been shipped;  it included a very long number to trace the shipment. It was promised for February 6th, but did not arrive. On February 16th you wrote me that the shipment was never made.  Now which is it?  Did you have it, and misplace it in the process, or did you lie when you said it was already send out?  I have had otherwise good results in  my purchases from amazon,  but this is a real mess-up. I wrote to ask how to reorder, and this is the only response since then.  Is there anything you can do to change this problem.? Do you reprint reviews of your service
dvd||5.0||This movie will bring up your racial prejudices in ways that most movies just elude to.  It demonstrates how connected we all are as people, and how seperated we are by only one thing - our viewpoints.  The acting is superb, and you get one cameo appearance after another, which is a treat.  Of course, the soundtrack is terrific.  The ending is intense to witness, one situation after another coming to an unfortunate finish. 
dvd||2.0||	The saga of the candyman continues in this third installment of the hit series. I can remember the first time I watched the original created by Clive Barker, I luv'd it, the same can't be said for this film. Caroline is last living descendent of the candyman, and he wants to end it all by ending her. All who watch this film and the acting of Donna D' Errico will wish for the same thing. One would only think that she got the job to secure watchers of Baywatch for the film and for that reason only, or maybe it's because a little fragile thing like her can't take on candyman head on. Get a real actress like KATHY BATES in there and she'll kick his ass {MISERY is a classic}.As far as Tony Todd is concerned he does a good job in this film, but not as scary as he has been in the other films. He does a good job none the less, and serves as a co-producer. As far as the script goes it's a decent attempt at the franchise, Al Septien & director Turi Meyer do what they can. But that doesn't save the film from being less then average. Side performances from the art gallery owner, the two bad cops, and the gypsy women are great and save the film a little. 	There isn't much to the story, Caroline is his last descendent and he wants to stop his pain by taking her. People she knows gets killed so it looks like she did it, and she tries to stop him, that's it nothing more to it. Over all a more worthy sequel of its predecessors would be more enjoyable.
dvd||1.0||I really want to give this piece of garbage a Zero. Actually, I only watched part of one episode, I don't know if it's from season one. I am a Columbo fan, and a detective writer. I saw a sniper shoot a man on a platform. The platform was almost located right up against a building the sniper was in! A toilet with flowers in it. He reacts to colds? I saw a classroom full of kids. EVERY ONE had a cold! Not very realistic. Kiddie video game pacing, with no proper build up. They don't make stuff for intelligent people anymore! If you are new to this series, watch some before you buy. Maybe some of it is ok. 
dvd||5.0||We LOVE these movies!  They entertain the child as well as the adult!  We went through a period where we watched these every night before bed!  Much better than the Baby Einstein Collection!  We've made this our designated baby shower gift!  Everyone should have a copy!  They are good for parents as a stress relief.  You don't even need to watch them, just have them playing in the background, the music is absolutely wonderful.  I love when I catch my kids humming the music as they are playing.  Perfect for any age, boy or girl!  Thank you HBO
dvd||4.0|| I don't think so, be it in the jungle, a New York high rise or at sea. Hepburn & Tracy were great, no argument. But they were so modern & urbane, not rowdy & sexy, always fighting like Harlow & Gable. China Seas is a fine example of this chemistry.  Yeah, & its a pretty good story too. Gable is Capt. Gaskell, skipper of a passenger/merchant ship running from Hong Kong to Singapore. Harlow is the floozie, Dolly, he had a fling with on shore. The ship is carrying gold. There is a terrific typhoon, & a pirate raid in which the ship is seized for a while. They torture the Captain, but he doesn't reveal where the gold is. Dolly is mixed up in a conspiracy with a crewman, Wallace  Berry, against the Captain because she is mad at him. She of course changes her mind. The Captain is trying to ditch Dolly & thinks he's meant for Lady Sybil, played by Rosalind Russell, an old flame. But he & Dolly really are in love. Unfortunately the collaborations between Harlow & Gable was cut short at five movies with Harlow untimely & early death several years later.

dvd||1.0||I like Pauley Shore I have seen him in other movies that I liked so I made the mistake of buying the Jury Duty video because I liked In The Army Now and Bio-Dome and assumed I would like this too, well I learned my lesson well and I learned it the hard way and wasted my money and I have learned to never assume I will like a movie because I liked the actor in another movie and from now on I will rent the movie first! Jury Duty simply was just plain awful with it's weak, boring plot and unfunny humor! In The Army Now and Bio-Dome were a lot funnier, and if you want to kick back, relax and laugh your [backside] off than watch those movies
dvd||1.0||This is without question the worst movie ever made. It makes "Plan 9 from Outer Space" look like "2001". Roger Ebert must be a genius. No one could "accidentally" make a movie this bad. I guess it's a comedy - that is if you find the contents of a toilet funny
dvd||5.0||Ferris Bueller (Matthew Broderick) is a kind of hero to every high-school aged young adult out there. He's the kind of guy whom we all want to be, really. He acts like he doesn't have a care in the world, and lives life to fullest. The opposite of this guy would be his best friend Cameron Frye (Alan Ruck), a sort of uptight worrywart who deserves to be brought out of his shell by the easygoing Ferris. In this film, Ferris fakes out his parents into calling it another "sick" day for him, his ninth to be exact. In order to convince just about everyone that he is really sick, he consults his collection of electronic sound effect equipment for the process. Another antithesis of Ferris is his life-is-not-fair sister Jeannie(Jennifer Grey) who suspects something is up, as does the sly-but-not-so-slick Dean of Students, Ed Rooney (Jeffrey Jones).It's funny how so many trains of thoughts seem to dominate this movie and in the events that happen For instance, Ferris says that he has to keep coming up with new illnesses in order to make 10 sick days. It's amazing; people, like his parents who are most easily duped, would think that this one sick kid when in reality, he's having a ball. However, knowing that if he gets cauught and may not graduate, he decides to make this one count and be worthwhile. Ferris and Cameron bail out Ferris' girl Sloane (Mia Sara) with a dead grandmother ploy, and together the trio spend the day doing the town in Chicago driving the '61 GT convertible (Oh, yeah!). This movie has a special message and feeling to it that's as old as time. It's about conquering fears mostly and just really appreciating life. For after all, as our hero says: "Life moves pretty fast; if you don't stop to take a look every once in a while, you might miss it." That's the moral of the story, really. "Bueller...Bueller...Bueller?" Not here, but he'll be there in your own home sharing his funny but wise philosophies of life, and showing you how to open your eyes in making the most of every day
dvd||5.0||Scenes from a Marriage is a Swedish film by Ingmar Bergman. To me, this is one of the best films ever. It not only captures a great story, but it is done so well.What makes the movie so great is that you can relate to how they feel, act, and generally take care of issues.This isn't one of those American films where a person breaks off with someone and they start yelling and throwing objects at them.In here, as he is telling his wife about this other lover, she is without emotions, just staring off, with no real reactions whatsoever, a way most would respond.This is basically a 3 or 5 hour film about a wife who believes their marriage is great/perfect. It is later that she finds outs that perhaps, the marriage isn't so great when she listens to a patient decribe her marriage and why she wants a divorce.There, the wife wants to plan a trip with her husband and try to improve their marriage. He later says he's been with a woman for a while now, and shortly there after, leaves her.After a year of so, they get together to sign the divorce papers, which turns out rough at the end.After some time, they get together again, and in some way, fall in love once again, even though both are married to other people.There, the movies ends.Great film! Hard to watch some american films now, because most just seem horrible, and in ways, corny. I'm glad I got to see a great film like this.
dvd||1.0||Between the not so below average acting of Thomas and Biel, the film might have benefited more from a better script, but it did not.  There was nothing in this movie that they could have done better, it was just a fluff holiday movie that a family would most likely not want to watch that much
dvd||5.0||Love this dvd. I loved the live performance at the MTV awards. She has my vote
dvd||4.0||I became interested in this movie after reading the book "Ishmael" by Daniel Quinn and learning from a friend that this movie was based on the book. It was a very good movie and Anthony Hopkins is wonderfully persuasive but all the suggestion from "Ishmael" there seems to be is just that living in nature is better than living in civilization. There was nothing that indicated the precariousness of civilization - "takers" are mentioned but it comes across more as you just don't know what you are missing by being one - not that all of nature has had it. Heck, the movie makers would be shooting their own business in the foot if they were really to try and convince us to head back to the trees. But of course that was the main point of "Ishmael". If we don't give up being takers and go back to being part of nature, then nature has had it and so have we
dvd||1.0||Absolutely terrible. The most inexplicable comedy phenomena this side of Dane Cook. Nothing happens in this movie (and I mean nothing) except a bunch of sullen characters exhanging "comic" glances and looking withdrawn and cynical. I don't think a Soviet run production company could suck the life and charisma out of these talented actors better. So on that point it's a success. All the sullen, understated lines and glances are supposed to be funny-they're not, they're boring. Somebody needs to tell Wes Anderson that too. ASAP
dvd||5.0||I was reading some reviews of "The Quiet Man" earlier this year. And a thread running through most of them was that it is a movie that defies time, entertaining for the generation that it was made for and subsequent children, grandchildren and I imagine great grandchildren.In that league of the timeless you have to put Ben-Hur, a story of love, redemtion, compassion, revenge, retribution, foregiveness and tranquility, in an epic truly larger than life. If we are to believe that the best movies were those made long ago, then certainly William Wyler's third oscar winner provides substantial evidence to support that view.For me, seeing it again and again, I am always startled by Mr. Heston's skills as an actor, often missed in the size he brought to a film and his overall presence. Here the antagonist is Stephen Boyd, Judah Ben-Hur's best friend from childhood, now addicted to the narcotic of power. The two will clash; this is the time of Christ's ministry. Christ is seen as a rabble rouser and Rome, an international giant the world had never seen, seeks to thwart that message by girding up Jerusalem. So they send the now goal oriented and vicious Messala to the home of Ben-Hur.Heston is also supported ably by Jack Hawkins, a brilliant actor in his prime, as the Roman Counsel Quintus Arrius. Judah Ben-Hur, sentenced to virtual death on the Roman Galleys, survives a battle with the Macedonians to only save Quintus Arius. I say this as a prelude to my second favorite scene, the arrival of Quintus Arrius in Rome, a hero, with his trusted slave now friend soon to be freeman, Judah Ben-Hur. William Wyler spared no money nor extras in so many scenes but as Jack Hawkins climbs the staircase to bow before Ceasar there must be 100 steps! And the camera back away to see Hawkins in his magenta robe, draped over the pure white stairs, climbing the steps before a crowd of thousands and you get a feel for the enormity of the empire. In "Spartacus," also a fine movie a few years later, the script tells you about the size of the Roman empire. Here in this one scene, Wyler expresses it without reliance on the spoken word.At the same time, Judah Ben-Hur, remaining in the chariot at the foot of the stairs, looks around and in that one expression on Heston's face of awe and the size and the power of 1st century Rome, he amplifies the scene of Hawkins climbing the staircase.A great, great move. Well worth your time if you have never seen it. Well worth your time again if you have. 5 stars. Larry Scantlebur
dvd||5.0||"The Medium" instantly became my favorite show on television in 2005.  I usually am fascinated by shows with elements of the paranormal, which tuned me in.  However, it is the realism of the family relationship that is most fascinating.  Patricia Arquette who was in "Ed Wood" with Johnny Depp plays Alison DuBois.  Her Emmy win for Best Actress in a drama attests to her standing within the industry, but the on-screen chemistry with Jake Weber who was in "Meet Joe Black" and plays her husband Joe is riveting.  They fight, spat, try to mask conflict in front of their kids, juggle an impossible number of real-life tasks, and have layers of humor and romance that make this seem like a real family that loves each other and deals with the unusual circumstances of Alison's psychic ability.  I found after watching the initial show that when the reruns would show, I still wanted to watch them over episodes of CSI Miami that I had not seen.   When I bought the DVD, I was hoping there might have been an episode I'd missed, but I'd seen them all between NBC & Lifetime reruns several times.  I'm impressed by how entrancing each episode is and the quality of the writing.  Alison's dreams are like clues that she struggles to fit together.  What impresses me about Alison is that she sincerely struggles to do the right thing.  In a world of violence, it's often hard to be clear which way the moral compass points.  In the episode "In Sickness & Adultery" her tip places her on the witness stand with an unethical hostile prosecutor that seeks to embarrass her.  As she comes back that he cheated to pass his law exams and is cheating on his wife, she finds that her best defense is the truth.  The two older daughters are also jewels.  Maria Lark as Bridget often has my entire family in stitches with her offbeat humor like shouting at her mom who wakes screaming from a bad dream, "Mom, please stop doing that!"  Sofia Vassilieva as the older Aerial keeps the arguments at the breakfast table bouncing.  David Cubitt who plays the reoccurring role of Detective Lee Scanlon also achieves amazing chemistry with Arquette.  Miguel Sandoval as the district attorney Manuel Duvalos has such a focused calmness that he centers the crime portion of the show.  (Perhaps we will sometime see more about his family.)  While it's hard to pick my favorite first season episode, the complex plot of "A Priest, A Doctor & Medium Walk into an Execution Chamber" is a jewel, with the police chasing a ghost who apparently has just committed murder.  The DVD commentaries and introduction to the real-life Alison DuBois really give excellent background for fans of the show.  This is one show that reaches the level of art for me.  Its excellence will make it memorable for a long time & this DVD collection a valuable addition to an entertainment collection.  Bravo
dvd||5.0||You can't wipe murder off our hands; well perhaps you can, especially if you're like the two main protagonists in The Postman Always Rings Twice, an absolutely marvelous movie of dark despair and foggy, murky paranoia. Based on the novel by James M. Cain, the movie is all about the terrible consequences that can result from unchecked desire and obsession.The sexy John Garfield stars as Frank Chambers, a tough, enigmatic drifter from San Francisco who arrives in the small California town of Twin Oaks. Frank's a pretty rough and tumble sort of guy; he's a little lazy and a bit of a con artist, but he's decent enough and soon he gets offered a job in a diner run by Nick Smith (Cecil Kellaway). Nick is very eager to employ Frank, but Frank initially hesitates, that is, until he meets Nick's much younger wife, Cora Smith (a gorgeous Lana Turner). Cora is a blonde bombshell, a real knockout, first appearing in front of Frank in skimpy shorts, she's even photographed from the legs up. Cora is a teasingly sexy femme fatale, rolling her lipstick towards him in a hesitant dance of seduction, perhaps a promise of what is to come. The sexual attraction is almost immediate, and as the tension steadily builds, they begin a clandestine affair, taking moonlit swims together, while the affable Nick remains totally unsuspecting of what's going on. Soon Cora confesses to Frank that she doesn't love her husband and she that married Nick to give her a sense of security. Desperately in love, the two decide to run away together by hitching, but Cora decides she doesn't want to start life again with nothing and returns to the diner. By this time, Frank can't get Cora out of his head, and with both of them feeling ever more trapped, they decide to arrange an accident for her unsuspecting husband. But their plan doesn't quite work; the situation becomes even worse when the local DA (Leon Ames) catches onto them and their evil schemes. The plot takes many twists and turns as Cora and Frank try to outmaneuver the law, Nick, and also a pair of unscrupulous lawyers who are intent to see the sultry couple double-cross and sell out on each other. Despite the imposition of strict censorship laws, The Postman Always Rings Twice bubbles over with passion, even though much of the sensuality is suggested. And because the censors wouldn't allow any sex or violence, the filmmakers had to imply what was going on, so the film projects an undercurrent of barely disguised passions, sexuality, and murder. The censorship restrictions also make the performances of Garfield and Turner that much stronger. Relying on sharp dialogue and facial expressions, the actors manage to weave a gorgeous sensual dance together, both lighting up the screen and creating two of the most smolderingly complex characters ever seen in film. The Postman Always Rings Twice is a classical noir tale of love that just goes disastrously wrong. Lust, deceit, lies, and betrayal inevitably result because the two star-crossed lovers just can't let go of each other and are trapped by their desires. Cora is dreadfully insecure and wants something in life that has always eluded her. And Frank is too caught up in his feelings for Cora to see reason; he's just too weak-minded to see how warped his judgment has become. The Postman Always Rings Twice was remade in 1981 with Jessica Lange and Jack Nicholson in the lead roles. I've never seen it, but hearsay suggests that, although it is much steamier (minus the restrictive censorship laws), this version is still far superior, even after all these years. With its edgy character development, it's stylish photography, and with Turner and Garfield as the leads, it is indeed a terrific film and remains a verifiable masterpiece of Hollywood film noir.

dvd||5.0||I remember watching Anne of Green Gables when I was a little girl with my sister, over and over again. Laughing everytime Anne broke her slate on Gilberts head, or when she accidently dyed her hair green, or when she waxes poetic about her "bosom friend". It made me smile and laugh then and still does now as a 25 year old. I would recommend this movie for anyone young or old. It is a beautiful heartwarming movie, with gorgeous scenery, unforgettable characters, and plenty of moments to laugh and cry
dvd||5.0||If you are bored with Kurosawa's faithful decpition of historical Samurai (and who would be?), if you think the Samurai genre has been overused and outdated...then get ready for the hip-hop remix version of the age old genre: SAMURAI CHAMPLOO.  Directed by Shinichiro Watanabe, the man who brought us Cowboy Bebop and 2 shorts in Animatrix, with character design by Kazuto Nakazawa, Kill Bill vol. 1 fame, we are treated to a world that would have made the Wu-Tang Clan feel right at home.  The action is off the wall with the two main characters treating us to two styles of fighting that are the very antithesis to each other. One follows the strict laws of bushido while the other adheres to a style that can only be described as being the breakdance of sword play.  The music is all modern hip-hop, no moody asian flare here.The story is about the adventures of these two warriors as they escort a pessant girl across Japan in search of a samurai who's only distinquishing characteristic is that "he smells like sunflowers."  Lack of money, food, and patience is a recipe for disaster and wacky hi-jinks in this adventure-comedy.  Rated 16+ (the equivilent of R in the US) for bloody violence and language.  A must for any samurai genre fan
dvd||1.0||This director mistakes lame attempts at surrealism for art. Artsy-fartsy disjointed and meaningless scenes leave the viewer benumbed and wondering what this movie is about.  Speaking Russian is no help in discovering the point of this wan effort.
dvd||2.0||The slight actor in the title role is more suited for light comedy. Unintelligible at time....Not what the books are about
dvd||5.0||It wouldn't surprise me if this movie is shown in more high school civics classes than any other movie: it's rife for debate. Gary Cooper might stick his neck out once for this bunch of frightened citizens in the face of adversity, but when he throws his badge down onto the dusty street at the end, we know he'd never do it again. Sure he took an oath to uphold justice and does it because "I have to," and all that; but only a fool would think that a place like Hadleyville deserves protection. Can you imagine Clint Eastwood in Cooper's shoes? At least that would be one side of the argument after the movie was shown.Of course the other side of the debate would say it has nothing to do with Hadleyville and its cowardly citizens, but has everything to do with Cooper and his code of honor. Isn't this the same Gary Cooper who played Frederic Henry in A FAREWELL TO ARMS, based on Hemingway's novel, a writer who also dealt a lot with personal codes of honor and "courage under fire," a character who says in the novel that "abstract words such as glory, honor [and] courage were obscene"? How could he possibly look at himself in the mirror the next day, never mind looking his wife in the eye again, if he'd skadaddled? This existential hero had a choice to make, a life-defining one, and for him it meant only one thing. It's that kind of movie - meaty and meaningful. The real-time experiment is interesting in these days of TV shows like "24," and the McCarthy-era witch hunt comparisons are worth pondering, too. And let's not forget the music, either. But basically it comes down to Cooper reaching out and finding nobody there, and then doing what he has to do anyway. It's a timeless idea, and the movie is a classic
dvd||2.0||i don't agree with anyone who thinks this season is awesome. most of the skits are only 15 minutes in length. once again cheap fox won't buy the music rights. there is sections (i think) that have been either doctored or just cut out. you'll be watching an episode and you'll see the screen mismatch up for a brief moment. you'll think it's your eyes but it's not. thank you fox for butchering all of the seasons of in living color. even though my review isn't that great i still believe that in living color was and is one of the best sketch comedy series on t.v. so they're all still worth buying
dvd||4.0||'The Bunker' is one of three films that deal with Hitler's final days as the Soviets encircle Berlin and put an end to the Third Reich in April/May 1945.'The Bunker' is both one of the best and one of the worst of the three (the others being 1973's 'Hitler: the last ten days' and 2005's 'Downfall') at the same time.  The triumph of 'The Bunker' is Anthony Hopkins tour de force performance as Hitler, at times so exact it is as if you are watching a newsreel.  The element that makes the film almost painful to watch is that almost a 1/3 of it is dedicated to the whitewashing of convicted Nazi war criminal Albert Speer.One thing that makes 'The Bunker' different from the others is the occasional use of flashbacks, and although brief they do allow Hopkins to portray Hitler in different venues and in a relaxed mode, casually chating and enjoying the company of friends when times were fat.  In the bunker itself Hopkins turns Hitler purple in a full throttle rage as he yells about the need to destroy "the scourge and pestilence of Jewish Marxism!"'Hitler: the last ten days' does a bit better than the rest in portraying the supporting cast of characters in the drama but one stands out in 'The Bunker' and that is Michael Lonsdale as Martin Borman, Hitler's personal secretary and gatekeeper, a man of considerable power who plays his cards close to the vest and is always scheming to stay one step ahead of his rivals.  Despite its flaws 'The Bunker' earns a high rating as the Hopkins performance simply cannot be missed. 
dvd||4.0||If you are not familiar with research, this nice approach to a scientist's  work will open your mind to a new world on which ordinary people have many fantasies. Besides, this very interesting and moving film, with  high level and homogeneous performances, will show, the closest it can, the early facts about such a terrible disease. I strongly recommend it. I have seen it with my 16 year old son, but maybe it is not suitable for kids under this age. A bit too long lasting and complex for younger audience.
dvd||5.0||According to IMDb, "Moulin Rouge" was shot in 1.37, not widescreen.  Therefore you're not losing that much to view this in 1.33 (full screen) format
dvd||5.0||This film is the best film that Disney has in it's live-action collection! Every actor and actress gives their all in this great adventure that brings the ride to life. I really like all the extras on the disc as well I like seeing how the film was created, looking at deleted scenes, learning about the history of real pirates, and learning how the park ride was developed through the eyes of Walt Disney himself
dvd||1.0||A poorly-conceived, poorly put together mess.  Don't bother
dvd||2.0||I expected alot more from Richard Harris. He was very stiff and it was hard to warm to his portrayal of Abraham. Also, there wasn't enough vocal input from God, expecially since his promises to Abraham and indeed the world should be center stage and offer the viewer a wholistic picture of the first covenant. There were some omissions and scenes out of order from the bible. I was somewhat annoyed that the movie had God saying that Sarai's name means Princess and that he would change it to Sarah which means Queen. This is not true!! In Hebrew Sarah means princess. Such apparently small mistakes really withdraw the films credability
dvd||2.0||3 short films?!?!? thats it?? i feel severly ripped off even after i picked this up used!  it feels like the skits that didnt make creephow 1 were mushed together onto this. chief wooden head isnt scary at all. if you think that is scary, you are easily frightened. the raft is defiantely the best on here by far. that blob thing does creep me out i shall admit. especially the ending to it!! the hitchhiker is so stupid i felt moronic for viewing this. there is nothing scary or funny about a bloody zombie that says "thanks for the ride lady" over and over. i just want to know why anchor bay released a stellar edition if this heap of scrap when they could have done creepshow 1 instead. that one is better.two stars for "the raft"if only they all held up like that story..
dvd||5.0||This is too good to be true.  After purchasing this based on reviews alone my partner and I sat down to watch it not knowing what was about to take place.  For the next three hours, we were absolutely shocked and entertained.  This has got to be one of the most original shows ever to be created.  Its got it all; comedy, drama and twisted minds.  I have to admit I've taken a few lessons from Jill and her methods do work.  Seriously though it was just plain amazing and I hope series two will be out soon.  It is not for the easily offended but for those there is always the Brady bunch; the lamest thing ever to grace television.  For the rest of us, well...Nighty Night.  Highly recommended
dvd||1.0||I bought this DVD hoping that it will be a good one but it turned out to be awful and trashy. There is no story or plot to it, so I ended up throwing it away. I really regret buying it. If you're into sex, then this film is for you but let me tell you this, it is boring like hell.
dvd||5.0||This movie is one of the best movies to ever grace theatres! I think everybody is wrong when they say that the additional footage is not worthy and should be in the special featres menu because one of my favorite parts , which is when Vivian tells Edward that she wants to stop into the club to see her best friend/roommate and runs into her pimp boyfriend Carlos. The extras are fabulous and couldn't be better. So pick up a copy of this movie toda
dvd||4.0||There were loads of Swords & Sorcery films coming out in the 80's, most of them low budget garbage.  But this was actually one of the better films.  It had a lot wrong with it, but it had enough good to make it enjoyable.  Richard Lynch is Cromwell who plots against the throne, takes power as the young prince Talon (lee Horsley) eventually will grow up to challenge the tyrant.  Pretty standard stuff.  But it's exectuted well.  The opening is stolen directly from Robert E. Howard's Conan Story "The Hour of the Dragon" as Cromwell and his conspirators, including a witch, find an ancient tomb and revive a powerful, ancient sorcerer.  In the Conan story the sorcerer's name was Zaltotun.  In this movie, the name is Xusia.  Mere coincidence?  I think not.  But Xusia is played well be the towering Richard Moll (of Night Court fame).  He's suitably imposing and evil, as he quickly tears the heart out of the witch who helped restore him to life.  Unfortunately Xusia doesn't get enough screen time.Lynch always does a good job in the role of the villain and does so here, too.  Horsley plays his role clearly more influenced by Errol Flynn in Robin Hood than by Conan.  He's a fun-loving reveling rogue leading a band of rogues hoping to take back the throne.  He is eventually captured and Cromwell has him nailed to a cross, although it's an "X" cross so as to not upset anyone with religious symbolism.  Again, this is a scene lifted from a Conan story "A Witch Shall be Born" when Conan was nailed to a cross.  Only Conan had to be rescued by desert raiders while Talon, actually pulls the nails out of his own hands and gets up to fight immediately.  Now, I'm no doctor but I'm guessing that someone who had a 4" nail driven through their palms is NOT going to be able to pickup and handle a sword but, ok, it's fantasy so I'll buy it.Still, despite some shortcomings, this is an enjoyable little diversion.  The ending Credits even gave the title of a sequel which never materialized
dvd||5.0||On the face of it, a movie about a suicidal teen who develops a semi-romantic attachment to an ancient woman seems about as "niche" as you can get, but don't overlook this film. The relationship between Harold and Maude is truly endearing, and is as heartbreakingly dear as it is comedic. Through Maude (Ruth Gordon in a role that will forever define the agelessness of the human spirit) we get a truly unique perspective on life, told in such a gracefully sweet way that we cannot help but fall in love with her. If you like Igby Goes Down (a modern interpretation of Catcher in the Rye) you'll get much the same feeling from Harold and Maude, which is not so much a "coming of age" movie as a funny-but-deep look at love in all its splendours
dvd||5.0||Ok, so it may not be in the 5-star league, but it's a great movie particularly for those who are involved in scouting. My scouts think it's too funny
dvd||2.0||Thankfully I watched this movie having recorded it on my DVR so I could fast forward through most of the scenes with Uma Thurman and John Travolta.  Their scenes and dialogue were so horrible that fast forward was the only way to get through the movie.  Besides, this is not the kind of movie that you really need their dialogue to understand or enjoy it.  As usual, Uma's acting is simply dreadful. I tend to avoid any movie with her in it because I know it will be bad.  How she became a "star" in Hollywood is beyond me.  She is not attractive nor can she act.  She could have been replaced by a nobody and it wouldn't have changed the movie one bit.  I think when they need an actress who doesn't mind playing drivel roles, they call her. John Travolta is not much better.  His version of "cool" just doesn't do it for me. His diction is becoming more slurred as the years go by that I hate to hear him speak.  And someone please tell Uma and John that nobdody wants to see them dance so please just stop finding reasons to do so.  The ONLY reason I gave this movie 2 stars is because of The Rock and Vince Vaughn.  Their roles were priceless and had me laughing all throughout the movie.  I never grew tired of Vaughn pimping and The Rock primping.  While I fast forwarded through Uma and Travolta's scenes, I tended to rewind during Rock's and Vaughn's scenes; they were so funny I had to see them again.  Cedric the Entertainer was also pretty good.  
dvd||4.0||i found the movie to be very creative and unique. i thought the appearance of the movie was very similar to how a stage set-up for a play would be. i thought that this was intentional and it helped to place the focus on the words/message. there was a lot of different things going on in the movie which i enjoyed: greed; true love; spirituality; determination; self-esteem issues; and jealousy. i am not a prince fan, but i love the contrast in personalities between prince and morris day, and how this contrast plays out as they pursue the same woman, who happens to be an angel who was sent to change both of them (clever). i gave the movie a 4 and not a 5 because although it was very artistic, morris day lost a battle i feel he should have won
dvd||2.0||Being a fan of Cesar, I expected something new and informative.This DVD is nothing more than a bunch of selected episodes from his series.  So, if you already have his episodes on DVD, don't buy this, unless you want the aggression-specific episodes on one disk
dvd||5.0||I am a huge anime fan, and this is by far the best.  Lemme just say, God I can't even find the words to describe to you how wonderul this series is.  It inspires hope and takes the viewer on a journey into myth and fantasy.  The whole series is actually based on a true story in Japan.  A few hundred years ago, the entire population of wolves in Japan became extinct.  There are people there, even today that report wolf sightings occasionally :)If you're a fan of wolves, or looking for something a little different, CHECK THIS DVD OUT!The musics great, the drawing is perfect -- not just a random bunch of stills like most animes, but actual movement!  You get 4 episodes per DVD, each is a little over 20 minutes long.  This DVD includes:19. A dream of an oasis -- this episode takes place right after the incident at the keep.  Kiba finds a place where he is truly happy, and wonders if he has finally found paradise.20. CONSCIOUSLY -- this is by far my favorite episode in the entire series.  It has gorgeous music, and the scene by the lake will stay with you forever, just brilliant.21. Battle's Red Glare -- Orcom's men are fighting against an enemy, and the wolves are caught in the middle.  We see a lot of Blue in this episode (she's so cute as a puppy :) and Cher.22. Pieces of a shooting star -- The group decides to cross a sea of ice, but it turns out not to be such a good idea :(  Toboe goes crazzy and we finally getta see the runt kill some stuff.I can't say enough about this series -- unless you've seen the whole thing, you can't judge it.  It's made by the same people as "Cowboy Beebop" and this DVD is preparing us for the typical BONES conclusion ;)  The next DVD is way sad and very depressing; no matter how tough you are, you will be crying by the end
dvd||1.0||Well I went to the concert and the whole time while I was watching it, I was glade they where coming out with a dvd because DVD can HOLD lots and LOTS AND LOTS of information and why would they cheap out and not put every artist with every song on here why I WOULD BE 100$ I don't care I want to see it all. And well I waited months and months, wondering waiting for it to come out, I went there with 3 other friends and it was the thing of a life time. Then it was time the P%$%# @%#T DVD of the century. THank you EMI for destroying a historial document so you can get all your SIGNED Contracts on to your DVD. Well now all I have to do is use my Time Machine and Get a tape ready and tape the Damn concert. Wait TIme machines doen't exist well now I am going ot have to go underground to get it. But wait I still $100 will EMI Release all the videos on DVD or do we have to go underground to get it from someone who tapped it and is selling it. All I can say this is why the internet was invented for INFORMATION EXCHANGE. If they keep information paticularly this Historical Document from people, they will share it over the internet. The video doesn't belong to 1 Company it belongs to the world, the world created this and WHO does EMI think they are by limiting this. I am so sick and tired of this utter B$%# @#$T. No one should settle for this, I demand more and Everyone should demand more also.3 Billion People watched 1 million spectaters. And what does EMI Tell you, they will put the crappiest DVD together and then make everyone take the videos down of there website. I believe I shall find them all and put them up on Wikipedia because it isn't 1 Person who owns the worlds creation. Anyone who believes in this should know what it means to them Every Extra CEnt of this DVD should go to AFrica and it doesnt it and its a Bloody shame. All I can say Is I am making sure this goes on to Every Review for this damned DVD untill something is done about it. VIVA LA RISTANCE : D-THE REAL LENBO
dvd||4.0||Boy, did this movie suck at the beginning! And boy, did it just get better and better from there on in. Even the Oriental humor, which is usually so awful, was actually funny at times. The action sequences, while a little too often fanciful, were very impressive, even innovative. Chow is a talented guy. Having seen this I'm interested to see what his earlier work is like. If you like martial arts/action/weird comedy, you'll love this
dvd||5.0||I first saw this film back in 1987 over at a high school friend's house and have loved Isabeau and Navarre ever since.  This movie has it all: comedy, drama, and one amazing love story.  Who's heart didn't break on that one scene when the doomed couple could catch a glimpse of each other at sunrise?  Navarre's devotion was utterly breathtaking.  A wonderful, wonderful film
dvd||4.0||A fun musical comedy, THE TROUBLE WITH GIRLS isn't the usual Elvis Presley film but it's completely charming with it's faithful period recreation and fine supporting cast.Presley plays Walter Hale, manager of the traveling "Chautauqua" tent-show, circa. 1927, who gets mixed up in the lives of the residents of the latest town to host the show.  Hale finds himself falling in love with Charlene (Marlyn Mason), organiser of the children's activities; whilst trying to help local single mother Nita Bix (Sheree North) when she murders her nasty married boyfriend (Dabney Coleman).  Presley's numbers include "Swing Down Sweet Chariot" and "Clean Up Your Own Backyard".It's certainly a lot better than some of the other Elvis films from the same period; and seeing Elvis in a more traditional musical is a great treat.  Marlyn Mason, probably one of Presley's most formidable leading-ladies, is stunning (and her rendition of "Sign of the Zodiac" is a knockout).  Nicole Jaffe (as the amorous hotel clerk), Vincent Price (eccentric speaker "Mr Morality"), John Carradine (as a colourful Shakespearian actor), Joyce van Patten (disgruntled former channel swimmer Maude) and Edward Andrews (as Hale's beleaguered assistant) are also fine.  Fans of classic TV shows should keep an eye out for Anissa Jones ("Family Affair") and Susan Olsen ("The Brady Bunch")
dvd||1.0||Having watched great movies in the Bible series such as Joseph, David, Abraham, Jacob, Moses and Samson and Delilah and other good ones pertaining to scriptures, I was looking forward to another fantastic and educative film. What a let down by this anachronism. How low can one go! This is a disappointing and misleading movie that perverts the word of God.If you do not believe in God, have never read the Bible, particularly Genesis but have heard of Noah from hearsay, perhaps this movie might be of some entertaining value, a mediocre one at that.If you are looking for a movie with an accurate account of Noah's ArK, don't aggravate yourself. Avoid this movie like a plague.
dvd||5.0||Great acting and development in the multi-linear plot movie. Very heavy movie however, that may be out of some people's "reach" as to understanding and appreciation. Strisand and Nolte were both brilliant
dvd||4.0||The movie was terrific, and the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars, was because there was quite a bit of Spanish in the film, and the subtites from Spanish to English didn't seem to work on my copy.   English subtitles appeared for Engliish, and Spanish subtitles appeared when they spoke Spanish!  Strange.  Fortunately I know some Spanish, so i could sort of pick it up, but I don't know why the sub titles didn't work. Anyway,  Bogie was very good and the story was too.  Three men set out to find gold, and naturally greed and suspicion overtake one of them complicating the whole journey.  Besides all that were the usual bandits and Indians and so forth.  But it kept you watching and that's what really counts.  Won't tell you if they got any gold! 
dvd||1.0||I suppose if you never read the book, you might think this movie is good... maybe even charming.  But having gone into the theatre with this as my favorite novel, I was so grossly disappointed I can't tell you.  See, the book is about two people - Novalee and Willie Jack.  They head West together, until Willie Jack abandons her at a WalMart.  They part ways on more than one level - his life goes as low as a life can, and her life rises beautifully.  It's a study in contrasts, and it's done impeccably in the novel, with a plethora of complex characters to richen the journey... but it didn't translate because of Hollywood's froo-froo mentality.Hollywood cut Benny Goodluck - a main character in the novel - completely out and shaved Moses(another major character) down to a bit part while making Novalee's one-visit-mother a major player.  And they DESTROYED Forney... who is supposed to be eccentric, late-thirties genius, withdrawn and strange... they turned him into a twenty-something easy-going stud type with a crooked smile.  SO. NOT. FORNEY.  I never wanted to jump thru the screen and slap people so badly in my life.  That horrid.  And Lexie... she's supposed to be a size 22 with four kids and white-trash tendencies... and they put ASHLEY JUDD in the role.  Hello...?!?!  Does that picture at the top look like a size 22 with four kids and white trash tendencies to you? That's just the biggie complaints, too.  Read the book, don't watch the movie.  You'll be amazed at how inept Hollywood was at telling this story
dvd||1.0||Personally, I can't see this movie for dust. In fact, I find it extremely annoying. The only video worse than this one is "Monty Python and the Holy Grail." Yecch!Napoleon Dynamite, no offense to the actor, literally puts me to sleep. I don't mind his friend Pedro, and I also don't mind his brother (the dude with the glasses) or his grandmother, or even his irksome uncle, but Napoleon himself is as dull as dishwater. If they'd only take his character out, I'd probably enjoy this movie a little better.
dvd||5.0||In the movie Some Like It Hot its a great movie and its genre is comic and lovely.It takes place in Chicago and in Forida.This movie is about two musicians that accidentallywitness a gangland shooting and then they the other people wanted to killed them. Morover they two musicians Joe(Tony Curtis) and Jerry(Jack Lemmon)decide to go to Florida to participate to a girl jazz band. The problem is that they cannot go as boys so they decide to dress themselves as girls and to present themselves as JOsephine and Daphne. in they way to Forida they meet a lverlorn singer that is Marilyn MOnroe.Their plan is perfect until  Josephine falls in love with Marilyn Monroe. Then at the same time a old man falls in love with daphne and wants to engage her.One conflict that the movie has is when the old man tries to engage daphne but she told hin that they can't marrie and she gievs a lot of excuses to him and he says that it doesn't matter that he would forgive her. in addition at the end she says to him that she is a man and he asnwers him that is ok that nobody is perfect. I think that was a good conflict because eventhough she try to get away with it he accepts her without having a problem.The usual is that he wouldn't accept her bor being a man, but that didnt matter to him.The character in this movie are really good actors all of them had a great actuation.The only thing that was different is that the gangster got killed and i think they didnt have a good acting. all the sets wre good except for the one that i just talk about. The lightning in the movie was very creative it was very good, the costumes wre really nice and everyone dressed great in the movie.The music the movie has was ok too because it goes with the type of the movie. I had never seem a movie like this and i think it may relationate with the real life where people does this kind of things. I recomend this film to all the people that want to have some fun and entertain themselves with something good like this movie.
dvd||5.0||Very good acting and a fantastic script put this movie at the top of the list of must see movies of this decade.You have to decide for yourself about the spiritual quality and message but I personally thought it was well done.Joaquin Phoenix puts in his usual top notch performance
dvd||2.0||Unless you are an avid bird watcher and need resource material for north american bird sounds, this DVD is otherwise a waste of money.  Spend the extra money and buy "the Life of Birds"
dvd||1.0||This Pride and Prejudice fan was hoping for a modern-day movie with a storyline much closer to Pride and Prejudice.  Even Colin Firth could'nt save this one for me!  On its own I found it sadly lacking in just about everything I look for in a romantic comedy including romance and humor.   If you are a true Pride and Prejudice fan, I recommend buying the BBC series and the 2005 movie version.  Both are excellent.  I would'nt waste my time again with this one
dvd||1.0||They should stop milking it with crappy film franchises like the texas chainsaw massacre. This series should have been killed off by now. The first was not even worth watching! Stay away from this whole movie series
dvd||1.0||While I have not purchased this box set I have seen many of the episiodes several times as I am a fan of Spongebob allthough he and Patrick can be a bit pathetic at times. For example, in "The Idiot Box" when they order a TV just to play in the box. Anywhyey as someone has said in there reviews some dummy snipped out "Just One" bit of the episiode "Just One Bite" which is my personal favorite spongebob episiode because of the music as well as the humor. You all know it so there's no need for explanation. I think it's so pathetic that certain scene's in cartoons have to be snipped out
dvd||5.0||Dietrich Bonhoeffer is one of the religious figures who have most influenced my own spiritual journey.  His books are unique among serious theologians in that he never forgets at any point that his subjects are never abstract doctrinal issues, but practical issues of the greatest moment.  There is a great line in Kierkegaard, in the preface to THE SICKNESS UNTO DEATH, where he writes:  "Everything essentially Christian must have in its presentation a resemblance to the way a physician speaks at the sickbed; even if only medical experts understand it, it must never be forgotten that the situation is the bedside of a sick person."  What gives his books so much power is the context in which he wrote them, as he struggled to live out the implications of Christianity at a time when it was especially challenging to do so.Bonhoeffer was in so many ways a paradox and the documentary does a great job of showing this.  Raised in a secular home, he inexplicably decided to become a theologian and pastor.  At a time when a host of right wing movements were overtaking Germany, he espoused left wing political and social values.  In an age of growing intolerance, he expressed a sympathy and understanding of both Jews and blacks almost unprecedented in the Germany of his time.  And in an age when many theologians wrote academic works with little regard to how they should connect with real life, Bonhoeffer was obsessed with the connections between thought and practice.  What is most impressive in studying the life of Bonhoeffer, whether through reading his books or Eberhard Bethge's great biography or watching this documentary is the man's fundamental goodness and dedication to doing what is right.  If he had been catholic instead of protestant, he would surely by now have been declared a saint.  He seems to have had the saint's calmness and peacefulness.  One is certain that he slept the sleep of the just.Bonhoeffer was one of the most promising young theologians in Weimar Germany.  Had he lived in more peaceful times he certainly would have written a host of first-rate theological works.  Like his theological mentor, the great Karl Barth, who was himself the greatest theologian between Luther and Calvin and the present, he would have written works that explored the concrete role that religion must play in every day life.  When Hitler rose to power, Bonhoeffer could easily have fled to the United States and taught through the course of the conflict and in fact had an appointment at Union Theological Seminary in New York, which he left to return to Germany.  Moreover, he joined the resistance against Hitler and came to believe that it was his moral and religious duty to aid in the attempt to assassinate him.  After an attempt to kill Hitler through the use of an air pressure bomb placed on a plane failed (for whatever reason it did not detonate as it should have), a host of suspected conspirators were arrested, including Bonhoeffer.  He spent the rest of his life in a Nazi prison, dying at the hands of the Nazis only a few days before the American armies liberated the concentration camp to which he was transferred near the end.If one reads his ETHICS one is impressed by sections such as the one on what it means to tell the truth.  Kant had famously argued that if a man that one suspects is angry enough to kill a particular person comes up and asks you where that person is, the moral law demands that you not lie to the would-be murderer (though in Kant's defense it isn't clear that we are obligated to tell him where the intended victim is, but merely that we not lie).  For Bonhoeffer the situation is so much more complex.  He knew about many facets of the conspiracy and merely refusing to answer the Gestapo's questions would have done much to confirm the existence of the conspiracy.  Bonhoeffer was forced to systematically fabricate a tissue of lies that would mislead the Nazis as much as he could while protecting as many people as he could.  This lends a sense of poignancy to his writing on what it means to tell the truth that is almost unbearable.  Reading between the lines, one realizes that Bonhoeffer realized, contra Kant, that "telling the truth" might actually entail lying to the best of one's abilities.  I had only one tiny complaint with the documentary.  I love Klaus Maria Brandauer as an actor.  He is a powerful and subtle performer, but his voice on the DVD is very hard to understand.  I don't know if his accent is too thick or if the recording has too much bass to be clear.  I found I could understand only a portion of what he was saying.  Anyone who is moved by this documentary should certainly look further into Bonhoeffer's life and thought.  I once was privileged to be part of a group of thirty or so students who had a long conversation with Eberhard Bethge about Bonhoeffer.  Bethge features prominently in the film.  There is no question that if you were to read only one book on Bonhoeffer, his magisterial biography is the place to go.  It is massive, but it is unquestionably worth the effort.  I love Bonhoeffer's ETHICS, but it might be a tad too academic for the lay reader.  THE COST OF DISCIPLESHIP, in which he makes his famous distinction between cheap grace and costly grace, is a wonderful book and can easily be read by someone without a strong theological background.  LETTERS AND PAPERS FROM PRISON, which collects things written from the time of his arrest to the end of his life, is justly celebrated as a classic religious work.  A TESTAMENT TO FREEDOM:  THE ESSENTIAL WRITINGS OF DIETRICH BONHOEFFER is a very fine anthology that collects writings from every period of his life.I recommend this film as strongly as possible.  To me Bonhoeffer is one of the truly great Christian heroes of the past century, though his courage and sacrifice offers equal inspiration to non-Christians as well
dvd||5.0||This comedy volume is absolutely great.  While I'm a fan of the series, I thought this volume was more cutting edge than the next.  Definately don't watch Season 3 before seeing these seasons, because this is intellectual comedy that builds on previous episodes to some degree.  It doesn't move as fast as some comedy out there, but it all fits together better than most of what is on TV today
dvd||5.0||Wrath Of The Dragon.INTRODUCTION:The Dragon Ball Z series is one of the finest animes out there, as any fan of Japanese animation will tell you. The series has a "love it or hate it" reputation, but those fans who get into the series are totally immersed by it for a number of reasons. Young people love the series for the fast-paced action and adventure, while older fans enjoy it for the sheer number of characters, and the way they are developed and evolve over the course of time. It's no wonder the series is considered Akira Toriyama's magnum opus, and by far the best of the three Dragon Ball series. When Toei animation made Dragon Ball into an anime, they didn't copy Toriyama's mangas verbatim. They added in many sagas and plot elements not in the manga, often as a result so that the manga and anime were released at the same pace. Toei even created movies based on the series! There were thirteen movies, two television specials, and one OVA/OAV. While not usually canon to the storyline, they are an undeniable part of the Dragon Ball Z franchise that can't be ignored.OVERVIEW:This is the thirteenth of the thirteen Dragon Ball Z movies. THE STORY:Majin Buu is beaten. Our heroes have won. Peace has returned.Yeah, right. Just as everyone has settled down, Gohan and Videl rescue an old suicidal man, and help him to unlock the seal on a music box of his using the Dragon Balls. What they don't know is that this old man is from a race of warlocks who once unleashed a great evil upon the universe. The Z Fighters must join forces with a warrior who came from within the music box to fight against this unspeakable evil that once terrorized the universe. But are they strong enough?REVIEW OF STORY:This is one of my favorite Dragon Ball Z movies, due in no small part to the unique storyline, and some battle scenes that are absolutely spectacular. Granted, I wish Vegeta had a larger role, but no big complaints there. There is no other part of the Dragon Ball Z series that has a storyline anything like this. The interaction between Trunks and Tapion is excellent as well. And the ending? Let's just say it stands on a plane all its own. You won't want to miss it.OFFICIAL?This is a rare example of a Dragon Ball Z movie that could have taken place in the actual series storyline. Right after the defeat of Buu, this would fit into the actual series continuity. It didn't exist in the original manga so I consider it unofficial, but you be the judge.REVIEW OF DVD:All of FUNimation's Dragon Ball Z DVDs are pretty much the same as far as content goes. There is no bonus content, unless you consider the obligatory trailers on the DVD to be bonus material. And honestly, I could have lived without them. Some more recent DVDs have character profiles, though these are lacking and could have been written better. Why couldn't get get interviews with cast and crew, or trivia/facts, something like that? FUNimation has a lot of room to improve on the DVDs.THE DUBBED VERSION:Lots of people tend to bash FUNimation's dub of the Dragon Ball Z series? Why? It's inaccurate and sometimes just plain stupid. They can do good dubbed versions for plenty of other animes, such as Full Metal Alchemist, but every time they've tried dubbing Toriyama's classic, they butcher it to hell. The nu metal they put in as background music only further defiles the original series. Stick with the uncut subbed track.OVERALL:Get it. Dragon Ball Z movies don't get any better than this.EDITION NOTES:It was released in edited and uncut versions. Do I even have to say it? Get uncut. And watch the subtitled Japanese version.
dvd||5.0||I thought the film was great, it has a interesting storyline. It also has a interesting backstory on which the film was based on.I don't understand why people will rate this movie so low. Is it cuz it doesn't have a pre-Hollywood established actress/actor in it? That it isn't some mainstream unoriginal film, which even the most moronic of morons can grasp?Listen don't rate this movie low if it doesn't seem good to you, because it requires thinking unlike the mainstream cookie-cutter films in the theaters. You stay to your pablum un-original mainstream films, and leave those people who work hard on indie films alone.For the people who complained the girls were dressed too little, I've seen many more hollywood films where women wear nothing but string bikinis basically. These girls were dressed for a majority of the film.For the person who said Ashley was "plump", you must really like your women to be Anorexic
dvd||1.0||When buying a product, you expect a little bang for your buck. Unlike its counterpart Family Classics, Action Classics leaves far short of its mark.  Although these movies are old, you expect quality. Unfortunately, the sound is barely audible and the movies grainy. You'd think that because they're on DVD, the quality would be better. The movies shown are low budget (B movies)with unknown actors and limited action. Need I continue ??INACTION in this case would be best served.Save your money for better things... Like a hot fudge sundae !!!
dvd||4.0||Sea of Love is certainly a better than average steamy crime thriller, but it didn't really bowl me over.  Pacino's very good, of course, and Ellen Barkin more than holds her own against him, but Pacino's character can become tiresome after a while, and what I regard as a pretty sizeable red herring thrown into your lap midway through the story makes the ending a little less dramatic.  I'm not saying the mystery is predictable - it's just not that shocking of a surprise.  Frank Keller (Al Pacino) isn't exactly Steve McGarrett material when it comes to his career as a detective, mainly because the guy is basically pretty pathetic.  His wife left him for another detective on the force, and he's not handling that very well - drunken calls in the middle of the night to his ex-wife are not uncommon.  The guy drinks like a fish all day and all night, whether he's on duty or not, he gets into serious shoving matches with other cops, and he spends more time getting under the skin of his fellow detective (and ex-wife's new man) than investigating the crime at the scene of the film's opening murder.   Later on, he gets into a serious relationship with one of the murder suspects, which has to break a lot of rules in the old code of conduct.  About all he gleans from the first murder is the fact that someone plugged a fat naked guy in the back of his head and that the killer was apparently a big fan of the song Sea of Love.  Fortunately for him, a Queens detective (played by John Goodman) working on a similar case teams up with him on a two-man task force to find the mutual killer.  The common thread linking the murders together is the fact that each victim had recently placed a poetic personal ad in the newspaper.  Since no one seems to have bothered looking at any of the evidence too closely, Keller and Detective Sherman (Goodman) decide to place a similar ad in the paper, meet all of the women who respond, get their prints and compare them with those found at the murder scenes, and break the case wide open.Keller meets Helen (Ellen Barkin) at one of these undercover dates.  She blows him off early on, before she even comes close to leaving a fingerprint on anything.  When they meet accidentally soon thereafter, though, a spark is lit, and the two are lovers before you can say Jack Sprat.  Frank puts his feelings for Helen above his job, thereby leaving Helen hanging out there as a possible murder suspect.  This is where all of the suspense comes in; is she or isn't she?  The story zigs and zags both ways on the question, leaving the viewer in a measure of doubt until the very end.  The whole thing turns into a weird love story for the most part, with Frank trying to avoid losing Helen even as he sometimes wonders whether she's the killer he's looking for.  It is quite suspenseful, largely thanks to Ellen Barkin's very strong performance.  The ultimate ending's a little weak, but that takes nothing at all away from the sustained mystery that will command your rapt attention all the way up to that point.  It's not hard to see why the movie was so successful.  It just goes to show what good acting and a reasonably strong script can do for a movie.  There are probably two camps when it comes to the ending, I should note - but it's not a hate it or love it thing.  Some will not find it all that surprising, while others may feel as if it comes right out of left field.  Either way, Sea of Love is a film that all fans of steamy thrillers can lose themselves in and, at the very least, come out feeling reasonably satisfied
dvd||5.0||The first half of this film is the most accurate portrayal of USMC boot camp I have ever seen, outside of actually being there. I've read that R. Lee Emery, who played the senior drill instructor, was initially hired to coach other actors for the role. But he did such a perfect job himself that Stanley Kubrick hired him for the job. If the film had ended after the first half alone, it would have been phenomenal.The second half of the film portrays the same boot camp Marines from the first half who are now in Viet Nam. The tone and the setting are much different as the men engage in a number of battle situations, including a fairly gruesome scene with a female sniper. Where the first half of this film is almost comical at times, the second half is much more serious and grave. Overall, this is a serious and engaging movie that brilliantly describes military experiences on and off the battlefield
dvd||4.0||Microphone {tap, tap, tap}: Ladies and gentlemen! For your wrestling entertainment, I introduce to you the Lord's Luchador, the Mauling Monk, the Orphanator! Put your hands together for Naaaacho Liiiibbbbre!Jack Black (KING KONG) returns as another obsessive character in Jared Hess' latest cinematic offering, NACHO LIBRE. Most will remember Hess for his stunning direction of NAPOLEON DYNAMITE. Here he gets a bit more money for production and gives us a hilarious tale of a Mexican monk who's early dreams of becoming a luchador (wrestler) come to fruition later in life. Jack Black plays Nacho, a cook at an orphanage/monastery where his talents as a chef come into question daily. But the one thing Nacho yearns for is to become a professional wrestler. His contact sports passions are reignited by the arrival of a beautiful nun named Sister Encarnacion (Ana de la Reguera (LADIES NIGHT), and by a wily thief named Esqueleto (SUPERVIVENCIA), a streetwise thug with bizarre moves. Esqueleto and Nacho team up and eventual take to the ring, only to be beaten time and again, but still making money. But making money isn't enough for Nacho ("I want to win!"). Vanity gets the better of Nacho and he tries everything to achieve his goal of becoming a winner, including finding a shaman who gives him sketchy advice regarding eagle eggs. Finally Nacho learns that winning comes from within and uses his "inner" strength to make his way to the top.Silliness occasionally racks Nacho Libre, but it is saved by Jack Black's incredible physical comedy. Not since SCHOOL OF ROCK has he been so well cast. The training scenes alone are worth the price of the rental (Cow dung to the face? A wasps nest to the head? Shooting Esqueleto with a blunted arrow?) When Nacho tries to court Sister Encarnacion, the comedy is further ratcheted up as Jack Black uses his butt-muscle tone in a nut cracking fashion! 	Napoleon Dynamite fans will flock to Hess' latest film, and will probably be amazed at what he accomplished with a little more cash and a few Hollywood well-known actors
dvd||4.0||Hospitals are inherently spooky.  Scenes of so much pain and death, the very walls soaking up the agony through the years, they can slowly affect the minds and souls of those that work there.  The hospital in "Infection" ("Kansen") is in particularly bad shape. Losing money, unable to keep staff, the doctors and nurses working there are under-qualified and desperate.  Into this unstable environment comes a strange patient, with a black, infectious rash.  Slowly, the rash spreads, revealing a terrifying disease that liquidates the insides of a human's body, slowly driving the staff insane with fear and anticipation.  But all is not as it seems, even then.I'm impressed that, even watching as much J-Horror as I do, "Infection" still managed to creep me out.  It was unexpectedly good.  Director Masayuki Ochiai knows the things in a hospital that can make you cringe, and he uses them to their fullest extent.  He also keeps you guessing as to exactly what kind of horror movie this is.  Is it about a devastating biological infection?  Are those ghosts?  Is that a serial killer?  All of his images and slow revelations of the story keep making less and less sense, disorientating you just when you think you have a handle on it, until the final page is revealed and it all comes crashing home."Infection" isn't quite a gross-out flick, like "Ichi the Killer," but it definitely relies on visual shock for its scares while keeping a good atmosphere.  If anything, it manages to combine the creepy mood of J-Horror ghost films like "Ring" while still delivering on cringe-worthy gore.  One scene in particular had me going.  When you see the movie, you will know what it was.As part of the "J-Horror Theater" series, and directer by a relatively new-comer who's experience has mainly been doing horror TV shows, I didn't have high expectations for this film.  I thought it would be a cheap job, done to cash in on the current J-Horror fad.  I was wrong. It is quite a well made little horror flick, not outstanding or groundbreaking, but really excellent for what it is
dvd||1.0||The acting was stiff and vapid, the filming was grainy and amateurish, the story was non-existent. A good Rx for insomnia, this forgettable piece of rubbish has only one redeeming quality: Seeing young Jim Carey trying to make the most of a boring script and insipid role
dvd||2.0||I'm a fan of the 1999 "The Mummy" and was understandably looking forward to this sequel. In the summer of 2001 I went to catch it at the theater with two friends and after about ten minutes we were all bored senseless by the incredible bombardment of action and F/X. We just layed back in our seats for the next two hours in utter tedium.  It's a curious thing that too much action (and F/X) in a film can be boring. It may not seem logical but it's true, and "The Mummy Returns" is Exibit A. I recently considered the possibility that my first impression may have been in error so I decided to re-watch it after over five years. Yet, after a mere 10-15 minutes I was again completely detached from the picture, even though there were all kinds of exciting things going on, or, at least, things that SHOULD HAVE been exciting.  "The Mummy Returns" has a lot going for it: A great cast, locations, costumes, cinematography, F/X, etc. In addition it has a great Indiana Jones appeal. Unfortunately it all adds up to a cinematic piece of excrement. What went wrong? Simply put, no substance. "The Mummy Returns" abandons the characters, and the plot is utilized simply as a flimsy clothesline for action and F/X sequences.FINAL ANALYSIS: "The Mummy Returns" has so many ingredients right, but it somehow utterly fails. It's unadulterated cinematic JUNK. It should be utilized in filmmaking classes as the quintessential example of style over substance -- having all the right elements, including budget, and stupefyingly fumbling the ball. Needless to say this could have been a great film franchise, but it was not to be. "Returns" put an end to that.  
dvd||2.0||Peter Segal's "Anger Management" is a film with nothing going for it.  It is best described as boring, annoying, and devoid of laughs.Mild-mannered Dave Buznik (Adam Sandler) is sent to anger management counseling after an unfortunate misunderstanding.  He immediately develops a problematic relationship with Buddy Rydell (Jack Nicholson), the self-help expert leading the sessions.  As the two men spend more and more time together, Buznik starts to wonder if his counselor is the one who should be undergoing counseling.   "Anger Management" just does not get as much mileage out of its premise as it would like.  It is essentially a one-joke film that wears out its welcome very quickly.  Sandler and Nicholson are saddled with a script that fails to produce even a snicker.  Furthermore, the parade of cameos throughout the film add nothing to the story and just feel like a lame attempt to squeeze in as many recognizable faces as possible into the proceedings.  Truth be told, "Anger Management" is one of those projects that was green-lighted because of the talent involved and not because of its quality. 
dvd||2.0||How could Mr. Cameron take a subject like this and a cast and brig out the worst in everybody?The production design and cinematopraphy are sumptuos, but the script and dialogue are so banal, the fine cast delivering one empty performance after another. (Including Leo, who was so good in "What's Eating Gilbert Grape?" in 1993 when I didn't yet know who he was, I thought he was really a cute little retarded kid... yet in "Titanic", there's just nothing there--- or nothing permitted). Talk about a SHIP wreck!!Only the two studio-backed block voting resulted in the record-tying Oscar wins/nominations.  
dvd||4.0||A lot of people like me who watches superhero movies want to watch a whole bunch of action with soo much CGI you cant even tell what's real or not. Anyways, I expected this movie to have the too much action I can handle. Guess I was wrong. Don't get me wrong, I like this movie, but I just hope Spidey 3 will have tons of action!!!!!!!! And Tons of CGI EFFECTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!With 3 NEW VILLAINS!!!!!! WHOO HOO!!!!!!!! SANDMAN, HOBGOBLIN, and VENOM!!!!!!!!! Anwyays, just don't make the movie about Peter Parker, but Spider-Man, THANK YOU Stan Lee for creating Spider-man
dvd||5.0||Since I've already reviewed and bought both of these as separate items, I'm not gonna repeat anything about each show (see individual reviews for that).  I will just rehash what I have all along.  Despite its missing pieces from the book, the Original is still 5 star material.  The "in betweener" is only worth it's value because it is a disc copy (as opposed to a tape copy).  My advice, buy the Original separately, and read the book to get the "real missing years".  If you are building a library of "ALL Richard Chamberlain", then buy both or this combo.  But be prepared to be disappointed in what the alleged "Missing Years" has to offer (again see separate review)
dvd||2.0||This movie was a bit lame for me.  Robin Williams relied on his same old schtick for the whole movie, and the supporting cast wasn't much better, but the worst thing about this movie is that nearly the whole thing is shot in front of a green screen.  Even if this had been a good movie, the green screen was very distracting.  I would have given it 3 stars without all of the green screen stuff
dvd||1.0||this must have seemed like a great idea at the time,"cast culkin against type as a killer child and show his range as an actor". the problem is his range is all the way from a to b.  this movie never explains how or why the boy turns killer and asks us to except one too many "chance" happenings. in the end all we get is this "thriller"(and i use the term very loosely)that thinks just the idea of culkin as a killer is thrilling
dvd||5.0||The "Back to the Future" trilogy was excellent.  The item was in perfect condition and arrived quickly.  My husband, who owns a DeLorean, was happy to get the whole story and we have enjoyed watching the old movies. 
dvd||5.0||My children (ages 6 and 11) absolutely love HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL. My son's drama club is preparing to perform it this spring, and he's very excited about trying out for a part. I enjoyed watching it as well. The musical is set in a fairy tale high school, but what musical isn't a fairy tale? Puppy love and teen rivalry ... all done in a family-friendly Disney way. Walt would have been proud
dvd||1.0||I am a fan of historical fiction, and this has to be one of the most historically inaccurate films I have ever seen! What bothers me the most is that the general public, who hasn't read the Tudor biographies like some of us have, will believe this stuff because it is their only exposure to the subject! I won't go into all the inaccuracies since other reviewers have already touched on them. Why tamper with history, when it was actually more fascinating than what was portrayed in this movie.

dvd||1.0||This movie is no "Heathers."  It's not even "Mean Girls."  As hard as it tried to be witty, shocking, dark, and satirical, it just made me want to bang my head against a wall to make the pain of watching it stop.  Maybe I'm just too old for this drivel -- although I could watch "Clueless" and "The Craft" until my DVD player breaks -- but whatever entertainment value this movie was trying to push, I just didn't get it.  The movie wasn't funny (which is sad to say when one of my favorite comedic actresses, Carol Kane, couldn't even elicit a smile out of me), the plot was full of holes, and the writing seemed very rushed and contrived.  I wasn't expecting greatness when I watched Jawbreakers, but I was at least hoping for 1 1/2 hours of mindless entertainment.  Unfortunately, the "entertainment" piece was dropped and I was just left with "mindless.
dvd||2.0||Of course the Criterion Collection has wonderful extras and a great transfer. The problem is the film itself.Preston Sturges made some genuinely profound films such as The Lady Eve, Unfaithfully Yours, and Hail the Conquering Hero that are rich and complex experiences. But Sullivan's Travels is   simplistic, pretentious, and false.As the film's characters themselves point out, poverty is only intersting to the rich, whose view of it is distorted. Odd-faced character actors in dingy sets make a rich man's view of poverty and not at all related to the real thing. Sturges was one of the most highly-paid men in America, so his view of the subject matter is (like characters say in the film) based on cliche.The climax with its chain-gang laughing at a cartoon, is pretty dopey and a fairly unconvincing argument for comedy. Sturges would do better to point to how comedy in his best films allows him to examine self-deception, angry love, role playing and a host of other themes--in other words how humor gets into the darkest and most ambigous areas of human life that "serious" drama cannot so easily reach.This film is exactly the kind of film that Sullivan wants to make--which is why it is so overearnest and uninteresting.  If you want to see the genious of Preston Sturges, watch any of his other films (even Harold Diddlebock) in their entirety. After the first 10 minutes a simplemindedness takes over Sullivan's Travels that make makes it a dispiriting film.

Now dont get me wrong, it was funny, I'll give it that, that's the only reason it got 2 stars, but season 1-4 raised the comedy standeard so high and were so funny but this season was a huge failure IN LIVING COLOR wise. So I'd recomend this for the series collectors like me. meaning I have season 1-4 and although I didnt like season 5, I'd feel uncomplete without it
dvd||2.0||I liked this movie but I also didn't like it.the story line was very predictable. I saw a similar movie of true movies.the acting was fairly good. it does go to show how ignorant people are when it comes to Rape.after watching this movie I realise why many rapes go unreported
dvd||4.0|| I love Leslie Sansone's videos. She's quirky and a bit "ditzy", but her workouts are always easy to follow and fun; this is no exception. There have been previous complaints about her cues not being good enough, but I had absolutely no problems- even on my first try. If you don't want to miss a beat, pay close attention at first- you'll hear the directions. I bought this because I loved Walk and Jog so much. Walk and Kick is not quite as intense, but it still works up a sweat. For a day where you're not working quite as hard, this is a great workout for people interested in a bit of kickboxing (but not for experience kickboxers).  I also saw complaints about Leslie saying some silly things about the size of her nose, dusting the floor, etc; this is classic Leslie chatter, and I personally think it makes the workout go faster. If you don't like the chatter of her other videos, you wont like this one. As an avid WATP video user, I give this one a big thumbs up.
dvd||5.0||Love it...love them all.  Disagree about the pace of this one.  Heart of the Jungle is great even though it is slower and you have to own this one just to get the Tea Party show.It is a must have.  Even if it is just for Polka Palace which is great unto itself. 
dvd||5.0||I grew up in  Hannibal Mo, so I am very familiar with Mark Twain's writing and his humor.  The make up is great as Holbrook even looks like Twain.  Holbrook is a great story teller, and he uses the material well, and makes it wa wonderful program.  I saw a perfomance live in NYC years ago, and another one in my current home town.  Each time I see it again, it is still funny and a great performance
dvd||2.0||It didn't take me long to forget this film. Once again it stars Jet in a strange role
dvd||5.0|| I was a bit skeptical about jogging in my home, but wanted a little boost from the two mile walk I had been doing. If you are at all skeptical, DON'T BE! I have used 4 of Leslie's programs and for me, this one takes the cake. It's fun, it's fast paced, and it works up an awesome sweat. You can feel the calories burning with this one. It's well worth the 10 or so dollars.
dvd||2.0||Maybe it's just me, but I really don't see the appeal of this movie. It's an incredibly small production (3 actors comprise nearly the entire film), with very low production values. Norman Reedus gives by far the weakest performance as the hitchhiker, but Alan Rickman and Polly Walker are not at their finest, either. (And I am an Alan Rickman fan just like anyone else who would even consider watching this movie.) If you are an Alan Rickman fan, chances are you've already seen your fair share of horrible and incomprehensible movies that leave you wondering why an accomplished actor would choose them. And Dark Harbor is just one more of these. Don't let the promise of a "nude scene" convince you to buy this movie - honestly, Alan Rickman is better appreciated with his clothes on. As far as the movie is concerned, the plot is unoriginal and not particularly engaging. It is a very dialogue-heavy film and the dialogue is not well-written enough to carry it off.
dvd||2.0||After reading the novel by Jane Yolen with my 7th grade classes, I was eager to view the film version.  I had heard conflicting views of the film- it's great, it's horrible, etc.  After viewing it for myself, I must agree with those who gave it negative reviews.  However, despite its lack-luster performance, the film did serve a purpose in the classroom.True, the film leaves something to be desired. They change multiple plot points with no explanation other than to just change them.  Editing was not a driving force because they could have easily made small changes to keep the film focused for a teenage audience while maintaining the strength behind the story.  Rivka becomes her cousin and other characters are neglected completely.  Major events in the rising action are left out, thus leaving the movie drab and disappointing.  Overall, very few of my students liked the film adaptation of Jane Yolen's novel, which they found so riveting.  On a brighter side, because of so many differences, viewing the film after reading the novel provided an excellent opportunity for students to practice comparison/contrast writing through T-Charts and Venn diagrams.  It also allowed them to perform some higher level thinking and questioning skills. After reading the novel and viewing the film, most of my students agreed that the book was much better- something a reading teacher loves to hear!
dvd||2.0||Saw this Movie at the actual Premier in NYC and met Sturla Gunnerson and I told him exactly how I felt. Gerard Butler needed a bigger horse. I expected so much more out of this film and felt empty handed leaving the theater. Sarah Polleys language was uncalled for in the film. They could have written better lines. The fade in, fade out was like a child filming with a video camera. The film was funny at times and mixed with gore. Like eating sweet and sour. Being a Gerard Butler fan I was distressed after watching this film. Why did he do this? Gerry Butler is an incredibly talented actor and made the most out of the poor lines and bad pony riding scenes. This unfortunately will not be one of his great films he has done in the past like The Jury, Please or The Phantom of The Opera. I expect Mr. Butler to be past these B films and know he does have much better stuff in the works...than goodness.All in all the film was terrible. The scenery was captivating and breathless. I at times found myself saying wow, but it was about the story of Beowulf & Grendel and it did not meet my expectations that I have read even in the easiest translations. All I can say is Mr. Butler your an incredible talent, becareful what you choose. Movies like this can paved the way to a downward spiral. I know Mr. Butler is indeed better than this.   
dvd||2.0||The most interesting part of this action movie is the centrality of the cell phone. The movie is a Nokia product placement, highlighting what awful danger you are in if you are not connected and, conversely, what a phone can do for you if you have one. The plot centers on Jessica (Kim Basinger) who is abducted because the bad guys think she has something that they need. Mystery #1: What is it? After lots of running/driving in various parts of L.A. the bad guys round up Jessica's family, while on the other end a pretty guy turned superhero and a would-be day spa owner cop are trying to help them. Mystery #2: how will the cell phone save the day?Mystery #3. Watch for the credits at the end of the film. They show up on a...? Yep, you got it
dvd||1.0||Love the movie, but the quality of the DVD put out by Alpha Video was so bad it was very difficult to watch. The sound was scratchy and muffled and the picture looked as if the brightness was turned all the way up. If you don't want to be disappointed and feel like you've been ripped off, wait for the remastered cut before you buy this one
dvd||1.0||Seeing what's become of the rock and roll legends I remember from when we were much younger, I found very depressing. I'd rather remember them the way they were 40 yrs ago. Even Jerry Lee looked like he was ready for the nursing home
dvd||4.0||"I Wake Up Screaming" was the first film noir made at 20th Century Fox. Its greatest distinction is its visual style whose low-key lighting and dark shadows would become archetypal of film noir after World War II. Cinematographer Edward Cronjager created a striking early example of "noir" lighting -what John Alton appropriately called "mystery lighting"- in this film made in 1941, before the United States entered the War. The story is based on the novel of the same name by Stephen Fisher, adapted for the screen by Dwight Taylor, who moved the action to New York, gave it a flashback structure, and turned it into one of those hybrids so common in pre-War Hollywood that combines multiple genres: Mystery, romance, musical (the singing scene was cut), comedy, suspense, and psychological drama. But the suspense does dominate. When model and aspiring actress Vicky Lynn (Carole Landis) is murdered, the police are quick to blame Frankie Christopher (Victor Mature), a fight promoter who met Vicky when she was a waitress, introduced her to all the right people, and managed her ascent to glamour girl -until she left him for Hollywood. Vicky's down-to-earth sister Jill (Betty Grable) disapproved of her career choice but doesn't want to believe Frankie responsible for her death. The Assistant District Attorney thinks early on that the creepy switchboard operator (Elisha Cook, Jr.) at the Lynns' apartment building is the killer, but sadistic police detective Ed Cornell (Laird Cregar) won't let up on Frankie, constantly harassing and threatening him, leaving Frankie little choice but to find the killer himself. "I Wake Up Screaming" opens with an eyecatching credit sequence of names in lights sprawled across a dark cityscape. That got my attention. Then we move on to an interrogation room at the police station. Frankie Christopher is harshly lit with one lamp, surrounded by police officers in the shadows. Gorgeous, dramatic, low-key lighting. The faces of some characters, even Frankie, are sometimes completely blacked out. I don't know if that is due to a film with limited tonal range or if it's deliberate. But it's daring. Everywhere we go in the station house, there are bars and shadows. The implication that the characters are trapped as if in a cage is overwhelming. The police station is like a template for film noir aesthetic. This really surprised me in such an early film, but it's fabulous.This was Betty Grable's first non-musical role. She's all sweetness and goodness, but she is also level-headed, practical, and brave in the mold of a film noir helper-heroine. Unfortunately, every time she appears on screen we hear "Somewhere Over the Rainbow", which eventually drove me a little nuts. Victor Mature makes a strong and appealing protagonist. But the stand-out performance comes from Laird Cregar as the very creepy, obsessed police detective Cornell. He's truly unsettling and one of the most memorable noir villains. The dialogue isn't hard-boiled except for a few lines delivered by Vicky. But "I Wake Up Screaming" is a superb example of the film noir style as it was entering Hollywood's visual vocabulary. The DVD (20th Century Fox 2006):  A few scenes show some white specks and lines, but this print is generally good. Sound is good. Bonus features: A deleted scene called "Daddy" (4 min), in which Betty Grable sings. This doesn't fit the tone of the movie well, so it was best left out. "Hot Spot" (text) is a brief account of the film's title change from "I Wake Up Screaming" to "Hot Spot" and back again. We can watch the opening credits for the film with the "Hot Spot" title (1 min). There are 3 "Still Galleries": A Poster Gallery (3 posters), a Production Stills Gallery of behind-the-scenes photos (8), and a Unit Photography Gallery of publicity stills (38 photos). It's interesting to note that scenes are much more brightly lit in the publicity stills than in the movie itself. There is a theatrical trailer (2 min). Film noir historian Eddie Muller delivers a good, nearly constant audio commentary. He compares the screenplay to Steven Fisher's novel, provides background information for many of the creative crew and actors, discusses the noir visual style and the juxtaposition of light and dark thematic elements in the film. Muller speaks a lot about the people involved in the film, as always. Subtitles for the film are available in English and Spanish
dvd||4.0||The documentary was really, really good.  They left some stuff out of it, of course, but you know why they did so it sort of makes sense.  One thing I did not remember was the prodigious mullet Brian sported back in the day.  Man, I think that thing was more impressive than Jagr's Cup-winning mullet of the early-90s! I don't know that I learned anything new from the documentary, but seeing his kids and his sisters talk about him was amazing.  Also, Stone Cold talking about the Hollywood Blonds tag team was great fun.  They really played up the Flyin' Brian stuff as being ahead of it's time (which it was) and the Loose Cannon character that had everyone guessing.  Funny thing is that the whole Loose Cannon thing wasn't really long-lasting if you think about it.  The gimmick was the talk of all three companies at the time but it really only lasted the summer before his Humvee accident brought any momentum he had to a standstill. The accident was glossed over--he was loaded on painkeelers and told of seeing his ex-girlfriend's face in his rearview mirror when he crashed--but the fact that it totally derailed his character was not.  He knew that he could have been the biggest thing going and that he had blown the whole deal and it depressed the heck out of him. Anyhoo, the official coroner's report was that he had a heart attack; just as his dad had at a young age. Of course, the fact that the juice and the vikes and a crazy lifestyle put take a toll on the heart was glossed over.  I mean, the WWE is not going to ever admit that the lifestyle of a (ahem) "sports entertainer" is one that is insane because no one can prove whether the job makes you crazy or if that crazy people are attracted to the job.  It's the whole chicken-or-the-egg argument on a human scale.  The truth is that he was an overachiever who liked to prove people wrong and when his body failed him, he became depressed and quickly descended into a spiral that ultimately did him in. Best parts were reliving the Hollywood Blonds stuff.  I remember watching it back in the day and knowing that he and Steve were going to be huge stars.  Steve even talks about how the team got over really quickly and that the plug was pulled by a booker who was worried about protecting his spot in WCW.  They never name the booker but I am 90% sure that it was Ric Flair back then who headed the booking committee.  I am also 80% sure that Arn was on the committee too.  They must have felt threatened by the Flare For The Old skit that set up a 2 out of 3 falls match for a TBS special in (I am guessing) 1992 or 1993.  Great stuff though; and Brian came up with the whole gimmick.  They were so hilarious together. Another great part was Jim Ross talking about how he believed that he had become a father-figure to Brian in the WWF.  That was sad stuff.  JR really had a hard time trying to help Brian but Pillman only saw the fact that JR order him to be drug tested as a huge betrayal. Overall, I am going with 4 crutches out of 5.  I haven't watched any of the matches as yet but I am less interested in that kind of thing than I am the documentaries.
dvd||4.0||I thought this was a wonderful DVD because of the following factors:*The goal of this Billy Blank's DVD is to get kids off their feet and exercising.  In this day and age of television, video games, and a joke of physical education in schools, it's up to parents to stress the importance of regular fitness activity.*The diversity is great.  The children on this DVD consist of both boys and girls, ages of about 5 to maybe 12 or 13 years old, all sizes from thin to slightly chubby, and different nationalities. *Billy Blanks is just a very good instructor and you can see why he's loved by young and old.  He motivates the kids and makes the moves entertaining for them, even throwing in a couple of old dance moves. :-)  Billy Blanks speaks from the heart and you can tell that he honestly wants everyone to be fit.As far as the fitness level, I could see kids doing this but it gets a little trickier when you get to the floor exercises if you haven't exercised in a while.  The good thing about this particular DVD is since it's geared towards kids, Billy places less emphasis on getting moves perfect, his main focus is to get the kids to realize that exercise is fun.  Overall, I think this is a great DVD to add to your collection.  It's something you and your kids can enjoy doing together.
dvd||5.0||Lets face it Woodey Allen has produced so much a few of his things sort of slip past some of us.  I have found this one did for many people. It's the kind of movie you watch more then once you have to wonder did the actors fill in some of those lines 'improv' or were those w. allens?
dvd||5.0||I am not sure why the first person would direct people to read J. Michael Bailey's work... or why the second person would say that it is as if J. Michael Bailey wrote this himself...one he couldn't have because it is a documentary, and two his view points are way off compared to the one given by the documentary.  Considering his book is very demeaning of the trans community. And he was forced to resign from Northwestern University as the department head, because of his illegal uses of his patient's information in his book. "They seem like different species, because they are."       I am not sure if I would say that the kids in this documentary are another species... or even that I am another species. They are humans as well and to reduce them to another species is simply rediculous.    I am not sure why everyone is referencing him, because his view on Transgender people is extremely negative.... but to the documentary. I think that it gives a great overall view of the trans community, showing that we can stem from all different backrounds, and we can act in all different ways. Just as there are many different "normal" gendered people, there are many different trans people as well.  I believe that  ScubaOtter "seaotter7"  has the best overview of it.
dvd||1.0||This review might contain some spoilers....I was disappointed with this anime. After all the reviews I read I was expecting alot more. It was slow in some parts and granted you knew somehow she would have to die considering her contract with a demon Chrono she just all of a sudden gets a stigmata and it is pretty much over. There was some humor but all in all I would not waste money on it. Infact, I took my collection down to the local half price books and sold it the day after I purchased it
dvd||4.0||About a young scientist (played by Charles Martin Smith) who goes to the Arctic to study wolves, their survival, and their effect on the caribou herds (he proves they are not killing the caribou, as it had been assumed). He is a fledgling in the wilds, but learns to become as resourceful as the wolves. He notices the wolves eating mice, and begins to do the same himself - a supreme irony in this Disney film. The first half is excellent, compelling and beautiful to watch; but the second half is marred by an incessant pounding away on a man-as-encroacher bad guy message and a confusing man-as-wolf Indian mysticism presentation. It's wonderfully photographed, though, and the soundtrack is stunning
dvd||1.0||So I bought this movie because some of the reviews said that the acting was terrible but the dancing was amazing.  Well, anyone who thinks that the salsa dancing in this movie is amazing, awesome, good, or ok, has never actually SEEN salsa dancing!!I am a salsa dancer, and this movie was HORRIBLE!!!  I have seen amazing dancing, and good dancing.  This was TERRIBLE dancing!  And there was hardly any salsa!It was 80s dancing to salsa music!  That's IT.  The only time there was actually salsa dancing was when the main character was training with the club owner.  Other than that, it was just 80s dancing to salsa music.  That's it.  If you want to see salsa dancing, I DEFINITELY DO NOT recommend this movie.  If you want to see horrible acting, and old 80s dancing, then I recommend this movie...There was only one thing that I liked about this movie.  The appearances made by Tito Puente and Celia Cruz.  That was great to see, but not worth buying the movie for....  Oh, and the story line?  What was it again????  Yeah...I love movies, good ones and bad ones.But this one???  The WORST movie I have seen so far...To the best of my knowledge, there aren't actually any movies with really good salsa dancing. Hopefully, someday, there will be
dvd||4.0||It is movie about the strength of friendship and how three men carry out a promise to a dying friend.How men will fight to the end for a dream of one man.The characters drew strength from one another.It tells about the hardships of the old west.The unfortunate greed of men and how greed can kill.Tom Selleck's character showed the the ability to love a woman and his love of his friends.The other characters complimented each other.The movie was well worth the price.You will want more of the same
dvd||4.0||Now with the release of the '38 version of 'A Christmas Carol' I can once again enjoy the antics of the grumpy old Ebenezer Scrooge as played by Reginald Owens. In my opinion not as good as the later Alastair Sim version in '51, but all in all a wonderful film that can be enjoyed by the whole family. This version is not as dark and scary as the '51 production, so if you have a young child you want to introduce to this wonderful Christmas story of transformation and redemption for the first time this is definitely the version they should view first. One of the essentials for your DVD Christmas collection!
dvd||4.0||I first saw this as a child during an "afternoon movie" event at my gradeschool.  Little did I understand then how well the film emphasizes the basics of parenting, nor did I appreciate the subtle moral of the film, namely that good guys sometimes do finish first, by the very nature of their untainted goodness.Oh, sure, I rooted for Charlie and his uncle, the poorest of the poor, simply trying to make ends meet.  And who didn't despise Veruca Salt, the bratty English tart--with a pushover for a father--who acted like the world was her private oyster?But having recently purchased and viewed this movie on DVD with my wife and little daughter, I was dazzled at how magical the Chocolate Factory still is, even in our age of CG film wizardry.  And without having seen the new version, I can't help but think that even the versatile Johnny Depp is not up to the task of leaping Gene Wilder's timeless portrayal of the candy tycoon, Willy Wonka.More impressive was the fact that this movie clearly dates from a time in hollywood when filmmakers were not above delivering straightforward, old-fashioned morality tales with universal appeal.  Several deadly sins are on display throughout this film, including gluttony, vanity, greed, and avarice; and the end results of these unchecked urges are plain to young and old alike.The lessons for children and parents are hilariously and sometimes embarrassingly illustrated, and I have to wonder if this has been preserved in the new film, or scuttled for some altogether more nebulous message more in tune with the 21st century postmodernism that Hollywood has embraced?I'll have to check it out.  Meanwhile, see the classic, and be charmed all over again
dvd||1.0||For that matter it can be written for any party candidate that wants the truth of his/her dirty secrets covered up. I feel that it's the most insulting film to be released. It hides the fact that we as citizens, and our government don't really care about who we stick in office. If the party lines up with what we believe in screw the fact he had to cover something up. I can't fathom why we continue to fall for this all the time, and believe me I don't feel it's right to air it all over the news either. I feel that it comes down to the man, and if he does have the values his/her party believes in then he will do the honorable thing, and own up to his/her mistake. This movie is just another nail to drive into the justification that it's alright to cover things up, and there are no absolutes, or rights or wrongs. Wht happens when we tick off the wrong person who's rich? Do we wait until then to change the moral? That's Pathetic, and so is this movie

dvd||5.0||No, he doesn't. Angel Heart centers around a down in the dumps private detective, Harry Angel and Lou Cyphere, obviously the devil. Well, not obvious to me at first...ha! The only bad part about this movie is the fuss people made over it. The voodoo dance scenes were apparently fairly in keeping with tradition. Voodoo practioners had a problem with this movie centering around a "devil" character since there is no devil figure in voodoo. However...the devil character has very little attachment to the voodoo practices, it just happens to be how the devil got involved with Johnney (the missing crooner).Mickey Rourke is stellar in this movie..Bonet is enchanting...Deniro is flawless. Worth owning!
dvd||4.0||THIS IS A GREAT DVD ABOUT CAGE MATCHES. IT HAS A LOT OF VIOLENT MATCHES ON IT AND A LOT OF CLASSIC CAGE MATCHES. BUT THE REASON WHY I I AM GIVING THIS 4 STARS IS BECAUSE MOST OF THE MATCHES ON HERE ARE JIPS.(MATCHES JOINED IN PROGRESS.) IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER IF ALL THE MATCHES WERE FULL. BUT ON DISC 2 IT HAS 7 FULL MATCHES BUT THAT IS STILL NO ENOUGH MATCHES. THIS DVD IS WORTH A BUY BUT REMEBER ONLY 7 MATCHES ARE FULL
dvd||1.0||Jessica Simpson is a talentless bimbo.  She is more concerned with shopping than she is with being a singer role model - a title that she so proudly proclaimed after bashing Brittany and Christina for showing too much skin.  We all know now that the hypocritical Jessica Simpson would shed her clothes if the price were right.  She is NOT a role model and her songs/tv specials are lower than below average
dvd||5.0||THis was the first scary movie I ever saw in the cinema, and it made a strong impression on me. The bathtub scenes were so eerie that I only took showers for a few years after I saw this movie at 15 - that is how much it scared me. I have since watched it as an adult and was able to keep it in healthier perspective, although I do have to say it is pretty scary and well done. Watching it many years later, I was surprised that it lacked a lot of the 70's cheese that you see in many films from that era. The carpet and some of the clothes were funny, but it didn't detract from the film. Glad I bought it
dvd||5.0||The main character, Lebowski, is a bum of a person living in Los Angeles who spends most of his time either doing nothing or bowling with characters played by John Goodman and Steve Buscemi. Suddenly Lebowski's life is changed when he is mistaken for another Lebowski who is much wealthier than he and who as gotten involved with a group of unsavory characters.The plot evolves as many other Coen movies (Raising Arizona comes to mind) as we are introduced to more-and-more colorful characters and the plot gets more-and-more outrageous, yet somehow still seems real.My favorite component of this film is the character played by John Goodman, a Polish Viet-nam veteran who converted to Judaism after marrying his ex-wife. He has a hair-brained plan to help Lebowski extricate himself from the mix-up mess and he doesn't bowl on Shabbos. He also baby-sits his ex-wife's Pomeranian when she goes out of town. If you liked Raising Arizona you'll want to watch this movie over and over again
dvd||5.0||"Annie Hall" is one of the most acclaimed romantic comedies of all time. The film not only holds a place on The American Film Institute's Top 100 (#31), as well as The American Film Institute's Top 100 Comedies (#4). The film took home 4 Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Director; The film is also without a doubt one of the best romantic-comedies ever made. It really nails that awkwardness of romance. I think few of us are like the neurotic Woody Allen and I don't so much mean the way the characters act, but the way they think and stuff like that is totally realistic. Woody Allen plays Alvy Singer, a comeddian who always knocks it out of the park when it comes to comedy but can't really get a grip on love. He's been through two marriages and is a little bit neurotic, which turns people off. Then his friend Rob (Tony Roberts) introduces him to Annie Hall (the wonderful Diane Keaton). Annie is a little bit ditzy and not quite as smart as Alvy, but the two click and begin a relationship that (to say the least) has it's share of ups and downs. Now, not only is the plot and the dialogue and everything true-to-life but this film is also absolutely hilarious. When I see a movie on AFI's Top 100 Comedies, I tend to shy away from the films on that list. Not because they're not good, it's just that they don't really pick by what's the funniest film ever. Example, 'The 40 Year Old Virgin' was funnier than their number 1 pick Some Like It Hot. But anyway, Annie Hall actually is very funny. The dialogue is quick-witted, some the scenes have become classics (Allen sneezing on the cocaine). In an era where romantic comedies run rampant into movie theatres, it's nice to go back and see the films that really made the genre what it is. This is a great film, a great romantic-comedy, a Woody Allen masterpiece.GRADE: A

dvd||5.0||I had been aware that once there was a show called "Mr. Show", starring Bob and David, and that it had been on HBO. But I had never been compelled to buy any of their DVDs until this weekend, when the power of Satan...um, compelled me to pick up the first two seasons. All I gotta say is: Praise Satan for leading me to this glory!The first season, comprised of four episodes, is fantastic, with flashes of brilliance on "The Gay Porno Video", but it's the second season that really will make you a fan. Such oddities as F.F. Woodycooks, Only The British Can Fly, Child-Labor Comedy Writers, the Iguana, and Jeepers Creepers: Semi-Star unleash the funny like you'd never believe.Mr. Show proves that there is a market for intelligent, hilarious sketch comedy...on cable, or in the case of KITH and Monty Python, imported from other countries. But Mr. Show is homegrown, it's comedy at a breakneck speed, and there's never a dull moment in either season. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll learn how to fight crime with a "crime stick" and ice cream, and enjoy tofu-based products while your business goes to hell...led by a red balloon. "The security guard and I shared something in common...Me!
dvd||2.0||I got this movie on sale a couple years ago.  It looked pretty good, but you know how most of that goes.  I really lke movies like Scream, I thought it would be like that, but nope.  This movie was a hundred percent perdictable.  I knew everything that was gonna happen in this movie.  From the first seen you can tell it's gonna suck.  *Spoiler* The first seen has a guy walking down a dorm hallway, when he hears a door open and close and goes to check it out.  The lights flicker (Wow how original) and a person... in a really, really stupid mask shows up and kills him with an ax.  This is what happens throughout the entire movie.  Don't waste your time or money.  If you really want to see it i would suggest renting it... not worth more than 3.00 anytime
dvd||1.0||I was excited when this movie showed up in the mail and immediately put it in my DVD player and sat down to watch.  It didn't take long for me to realize it was a cheaply made film.  The story was interesting and had it been done in a better way, the film could have been great but after having seen movies such as Trick and Latter Days where the acting and production quality were very good, I found myself feeling dissapointed after only a few moments.  It is not a movie I would readily recommend

If that did not happen, buy the Season 3 dvd's because Brendan Small is just immensely funny and enjoyable.  The Renaissance Fair episode is unbelievable
dvd||4.0||When I first watched this TV movie, with an unusal turn by Lucille Ball as a homeless woman, I was touched by the grittiness she brought to the role, and her fearlessness at looking like an unvarnished "bag lady". Although definitely within the "TV movie" league, this film richly deserves to continue to be available for new viewers to enjoy
dvd||5.0||I love agressive ski videos that just kick [...], and STORM just rips. No stupid bikini skiing or inner tube follies (that I can remember) just great skiing superbly shot with an awesome soundtrack. My neighbors can hear me when I play this. They think I have a screw loose. 
dvd||4.0||(3.5/5 stars) Listless beings meandering about the mall aimlessly, ashen-faced with blank stares; where is the horror in that? Sounds like a typical Sunday afternoon at the mall to me. In fact, Dawn of the Dead (1978) really does seem more like an action movie than it does a horror film. More or less picking up where "Night of the Living Dead" left off, zombies are on the hunt for prey across Pennsylvania. Four people arm themselves to the teeth with guns and other gear in order to survive the onslaught of lurching zombies. They take refuge in a shopping mall, which provides just about everything they need. They work together as a team and bond in the process of learning they need one another to endure. The walking dead are motivated by hunger alone and don't bring much in the way of strategy. It would be like shooting fish in a barrel if they weren't so tenacious. The four know they need to hurry out of there because there is talk on the TV of bombing areas of high zombie concentration. They have hope this epidemic is limited in area and that they will be able to find refuge among the living elsewhere. What does fate have in store for them? "The Night of the Living Dead" took place, obviously, at night and in the dark, which provided a much more frightening backdrop. It was also in black and white, which masked the deficiencies of the inexpensive zombie make-up. This is not the case with "Dawn of the Dead," which is in color and takes place during daylight. The "zombies" are people dressed as they normally would, but with their faces painted grey. The result is anything but scary. Tom Savini's effects are hit and miss, though always disgusting. Nonetheless, this is a decent film that features some above-par acting and a decent script. The Anchor Bay Divimax DVD is also noteworthy, with a clean transfer and DTS sound mix. An extra ï¿½ star for the effort.
dvd||2.0||We bought several different potty training videos and this was, unexpectedly, the worst. The reason: It lacks focus.  It comes off as more of a production made by people who never had kids, or at least don't remember what potty training is all about.It goes back and forth between Elmo and short film and animated clips that focus on independence and doing things for yourself.  But it doesn't really hold a 2 year old's interest and the song lyrics and such are overly complicated for a child of that age. My older daughter, who's potty trained for years now, watched it more than my son who grew bored really fast.If you are going for entertainment, get this DVD, but if you want your little one to start giving up diapers, go with Potty Power
dvd||1.0||I have seen many pathetic films in my life. This topped them. Did I rate one star? Sorry- I meant negative 11 stars. It was the absolute worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life. It was a total waste of three hours when I could have been sleeping. There was no point. The script and storyline were pathetic. The gore was overdone- too much blood, killing, and the like. It was totally historically inaccurate, and the Civil War scenes were so grossly unrealistic that it was laughable. All Civil War veterans are rolling over in their graves. Any scene that was supposed to be touching was pathetic. One of the abolsute bombs was when Clint Eastwood fires off a canon twice with his cigar- yet he does not even load it- either time. And somehow, without even aiming the canon, he knocks his 'friend' off his horse. The movie is a failure. F-A-I-L-U-R-E. Crappy. Junky. Just plain DUMB. STUPID. PATHETIC.I am not going to waste any more words on it. Just....whatever you do....save your money. Don't buy it. It's not worth 50 cents
dvd||2.0||I love Jeff Goldblum, but he didn't carry this film. The film was ruined for me the second Julane Moore (yuck!) and the ridiculous, lame token Black daughter of Goldblum showed up no doubt to satisfy nauseating political correctness in Hollywood all at the expense of this bust of a film. It's obviously too much to ask for a white protagonist to actually have a white daughter. What a concept. It just added to the disbelief of the characters (stay Goldblum), the storyline, and the ultimate letdown of this much anticipated sequel. Jurassic Park III wasn't much better
dvd||1.0||Added      - 5 whole minutes       - Documentary about how to make a great movie suck by     making it a Broadway production.Deleted      - Karaoke version of five songs from the soundtrack: Hold Me Now, Do You Really Want to Hurt Me, Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic, Rappers Delight, White WeddingWorth the extra $13 - I think notI suppose if you are one of the four people on the planet that doesn't own this classic there is a option of which edition to purchase, for the rest of us, it's just not worth it.

dvd||2.0||I was thrilled when I saw there was a new Sesame Street Christmas DVD out as my 3 and 6 year olds have the other three memorized.  And, as much as I enjoy being a Sesame Street Kid (37, just like the show), I was tiring of the same stuff over and over.  Imagine my surprise, then, when virtually all of this DVD is just the highlights of the others (Classic Ernie, Bert and the beloved Mr. Hooper from _Christmas Eve_, Hanukkah from _Happy Holidays_, and Bob singing "All though the Year" from _Elmo Saves Christmas" among others).  The only new part is Christmas future and it is a poor cartoon instead of new muppet footage.  If you don't have the other three DVDs this would probably earn 4 stars.  If you do have the other DVDs this is not a necessity.  Hopefully next time the budget will allow Sesame Workshop to be more creative

dvd||1.0||I agree with others! Season by season BOX SETS of Beavis & Butt-Head are what we fans want! With all music and B&B commentary and no damned edits of anything!Until then, Mike Judge & company, I will NOT buy anything B&B related, relying instead on my own VHS recorded episodes(limited in number of episodes as they are at least they're the complete original episodes)that I've transfered to DVD.I want each and every episode uncut and in their original broadcast order.Who's the brains behind the lame "Mike Judge Collection" series anyway?!? Some dumbass idiot working at Burger World??? Just from a purely greedy standpoint you'd make way more greenbacks by doing it the right way for cryin' out loud! Not to mention retain the show's and your integrity. Hell, even Beavis and Butt-Head'd think this "Collection" concept'd be lame and stupid!!Get with the groove Mike & Co. and give us what we want already!!
dvd||5.0||This was a wonderful story telling about the hard-working Italian immigrants that started their businesses in New York.  Their determination, long hours, and love of family represent the values those immigrants brought to America.If you love to cook & have an Italian heritage, you'll enjoy this film
dvd||2.0||Being a Texas Chainsaw fan I of course picked this one up.  It has 2 big stars in it, and was directed by one of the writers of the original.  I'm not sure what they were going for in this one.  Is it a horror, a sick comedy?  It is all over the place.  What is worse is that they made Leatherface a wimpy crossdresser.  The ending leaves you scratching your head.  Mathew and Renee do their best with the material
dvd||2.0||  I bought this DVD becuase I really wanted to learn the dance moves in "You Got Served" and was extremely disappointed.  The only routines they teach you are from the people who lost the dance battles in the movie and why you would want to learn those, I don't know.  The freestlye section at the end is fun to watch, but this is neither a good workout nor a good hip hop dance video
dvd||5.0||..Well..at least its in my top 5 =o)..I'm not the biggest Chaplin fan.more of a Keaton and Lloyd..kinda guy..But dang if this movie dosen't do me in everytime..I never fail to fall into hysterics over the "Feeding Chair" Scene..or the Gibberish song..and several other scenes.and I always get teary eyed over the plight of Charlie and his little love Gamin..This movie just packs so much into its 89 or so minutes and it all flows beautifully from one frame to the next!...Don't be botherd by the hype about this being a social commentary..or a Commie film or whatever!..Its still the same little tramp who goes against any kind of social order!!....Now I have this wonderful new 2 disc Mk2 version from the Chaplin Collection box to pull out every Christmas Holiday season..along with City Lights..as I'm want to do..and Check out the little Cuban documentary on the second disc about the Traveling projectionists who take the Movie to a remote farming village to show to the people for the first time..The Tears in these peoples eyes as they watch..tell you everything about this wonderful one of a kind film
dvd||5.0||I was so glad to see the entire season in one set.  I hope one day, if they haven't already done so, that they put out a Season 1 set.  Love the show, and being able to watch whenever I want
dvd||1.0||In the film commentary, Director Robert Altman said he thought a really good film should leave people saying, 'I don't know what it was about but I really liked it.' (That's a paraphrase). And I think that's the key to why this film is so bad: The director didn't know what it was about.  The weird, atonal score by Gerald Busby was an annoyance throughout, often drowning out the dialog. It's the kind of creepy music that comes in most horror movies just before the space aliens are going to appear, or in a psychological thriller, just as the nutcase is transforming into a psycho. Only in this film, the creepy music played on and on. That was it. No nuances, no alteration, no variance, no imagination. Just the same creepy atonal 'psycho' music all the time. Duvall and Spacek did a good job but the writing and directing were abysmal. Lots of shots where the camera stays on the actor for a loooong time, and dream-like sequences, conveying... mystery? suspense? drama what? Ah..I got it, they convey CONFUSION! That's it! The writer/director was confused!A waste of talent, and a waste of my time watching it. It is one of those films I watched thinking it HAD to get better. It didn't.
dvd||2.0||ok, I've only just seen this film for the first time, so it's hard to really judge the social impact it had 13 years ago and its importance in that respect, but this is not a particularly good film.I mean, it has its choice moments where it really comes together. the shot of caine downing a 40 in the korean grocers is imaginitively directed. any scene with o-dog is almost guaranteed classic status. samuel jackson's in it. and if you're a fan of dave chapelle's tyrone biggums crackhead character, the token crackhead in this film is worth a few laughs for his to-the-tee similarity.but that's really my problem with this film. serious issues are reduced to a series of ham-fisted archetypes straight out of central casting. and they're ALL here: the homey black grandparents, the nation of islam convert, the socially conscious mother whose son is starting to go down caine's road... all characters that might fare better in a different film that treats these issues with more subtlety and depth.take the french film 'la haine', for instance. it clearly took a lot of inspiration from menace 2 society, boyz n tha hood, etc., but its characters actually feel tormented, instead of just having lots of scenes written FOR them to show their torment. rather than just running through a laundry list of problems, one-by-one, scene-by-scene, it really gets to the heart of something bigger, some grander alienation that urban youths feel, which is what menace 2 society would like to be able to do. plus, if you can believe it, the hip-hop in 'la haine' is quite a bit better.so while I would definitely recommend seeing this film, keep the remote aimed and ready, finger on the fast-forward button. maybe about a half-hour of this film is really worth watching, whereas the other 70 minutes are mostly just dull moralising. oh yeah, and there's a really embarrassing-to-watch sex scene thrown in for no particular reason. oh, also, the filmmakers apparently think people who have just been shot look like they are being electrocuted while spitting out cherry slurpees. in a film that didn't try to carry so much social weight, that kind of thing would be ok because you could laugh it off as bad filmmaking, but it really just cheapens this one
dvd||5.0||Skillful direction, screenplay, camera angles, acting. :-)  I couldn't understand Benicio del Toro's mumbling.  It turns out he did that on purpose, as he said in the special features
dvd||5.0||Das Boot is an epic film that is very well done. I loved the suspense and terrific character moments. The thrills are well paced and we get a feeling of the boredom and terror of living in a Nazi U-boat in the midst of the Atlantic during 1941 WWII. Going 60 days with no sight of the enemy helps show the epic nature of the ocean. The three week storm is well crafted and adds so much more tension to the film.This movie is now one of the top ten movies of all time for me.In viewing the DVD, I chose to turn on English Subtitles while also selecting the English 2.0 spoken language. What is interesting is how the english dub has paraphrased certain lines and in others totally changed every meaning behind the statements. I'm talking about the line that, in German, reads something like "I can't wait to get back home and f**k the h*ll out of a few wild wh**es!" is rewritten and dubbed as "When I get home I'm going to shower and sleep until December!" Quite a drastic change. But of course, sailors in the German Navy use language that I suppose is unacceptable - even in an "R" rated movie - for English audiences... There are more than fifteen conversations of that nature that have been translated into English subtitles from the German language spoken in the original dub of the film, while the English dub is totally different. Later in the film, there are even lines shown in subtitles that are not spoken at all in the English dub. Very interesting and fun to watch.Even with the subtitles on, I enjoyed this movie from start to finish. I love the epic movies that run well over two and a half hours. This one clocks in at a good four and a half hours! It draws you in and keeps you going from the very first moment to the very last explosion... One of the best war movies I have ever seen!One of the most interesting ironies of this film is that the entire movie takes place within the Nazi U-boat and we get to see and feel compassion for the German men who fight to keep the boat afloat. The irony occurs when the Allied forces attack them and we get to experience the other side of the equation. Very intense and dramatic
dvd||4.0||I didn't think it would be that great and only saw it for Joshua Jackson, but the plot twists were really good and I enjoyed it a lot. And of course, Kate Hudson, whom I adore, (even though I didn't pay much attention to her in this one). But yeah, I really liked the end. And this is where I first heard of Norman Reedus. Then I saw the Boondock Saints. :-D This is a good movie and is very underappreciated. 
dvd||4.0||I woke up this morning with a burning desire to remember the end of Fellini Satyricon.  Someone is mortally wounded, the blonde guy?  And lies there dying, watching his best friend go off with the boy they both desired, Gitone, and some dancing leaping black guy....  I think.     I've seen it probably 9 times, it always was a favorite when I was a teen and older, but I haven't seen it for years.  But it was so visually entrancing, and so truly pre-Christian -- that is, made from that standpoint, which movies seldom are or can be!      I just remember the wonderul images, a boat rising in the mist, the strange tenement bldg they (Ascylto and Encolpio) live in, the sea monster, the bacchanale, the hermaphrodite's cavern, the Minotaur.....  endless, splendid, dreamlike images on and on....  [I wonder why it is Italians are such master of the visual in this manner; I think of Visconti, Antonioni, even Scorsese and the American-Italians -- maybe it's that Renaissance artist legacy?]From my buddy:  Like you, I saw it a few times, decades ago.  The images are so strong and mysterious. Images that render volumes of emotions that are so deep, echoing a memory that is never realized. Modern day, Scorsese manages it. Zefferelli too.That is true film-making. Even the older films from De Sica capture images that are unforgettable. Wells has done it.But what you're talking about, is, I suppose, secular in nature. Icons derived from the human experience that has meaning from within the human soul. Not from an outward omnipresence of theology.  Satyricon is almost existential, as a presentation of true human nature. Done with frame-paintings. And framed in such a way that is evocative.  Amazing dream art!
dvd||2.0||Thought it would be insightful but it was just dull and low-budget.
dvd||5.0||If you're a fan of vampires, werewolves, action, or gothic suspense, this is probably a movie you'd be interested in checking out. While it's not a groundbreaking film, it's a highly entertaining one, and one that, for me, is something I can rewatch several times per year.The filming is very attractive. Everything is dark, yet not so dark you can't see what's going on. The movie has a gothic look to it - from the sets, to the costumes, to the lighting. (Please don't mistake the meaning of gothic in terms of entertainment as the same thing as the gothic lifestyle.) The music, mostly heavy rock, fits in well with the movie. And the action sequences are expertly shot and exciting to watch. The movie uses several techniques made popular by "The Matrix", but who cares? It works perfectly within this movie.The only downfall of the movie is the complete lack of humor...there's not a single joke in the entire thing! Everything is so serious and dark that unless you're in a pretty good mood the movie could really bring you down...that's how heavy it is.As for the set. The added scenes provide more insight, and the special features are a treat, especially the 45-minute documentary "Fang vs. Fiction", which talks about vampires and werewolves. It was very intriguing.If you're a fan of this movie and you own the DVD already, I would recommend selling it and buying this version, it's worth the money
dvd||1.0||I felt as though the camera was clamped to a paint mixer. After about 30 minutes it gave me a headache so I turned it off.
dvd||2.0||First let me say that I thought Angela's Ashes was an absolutely terrific book and Frank McCourt fully deserved his Pulitzer Prize. This movie was a horrendous let down. No one involved with the film seemed to have a clue about how to depict real deprivation and poverty. Everything was a Hollywood version of suffering and misery, from Emily Watson's pretty red coat standing in for the real Angela's gray rag to the beautifully lit Irish streets and of course John "let me tell you how you're supposed to feel right now" Williams' cloying, inappropriate music. The acting from the children was great. They were absolutely the best part of the film. Of course, given the constraints of film and the average audience tolerance for unpleasantness such as oozing eyes, pimples and bad teeth all the kids were pleasing to look at, clear skinned and attractive. At least they could act! Emily Watson was given little to do. Robert Carlyle was good although Alan Parker seemed determined to sanitize the ambiguities of McCourt's father by only showing little episodes of drunkeness and thoughtlessness. Parker tends to be an extremely literal, by-the-numbers director with little understanding of subtlety (look what he did in the Pink Floyd's "The Wall"). This time he  was clearly given a mandate by the Hollywood bigwig producers not to make the film too "depressing" or "grim" so that audiences would accept it. The film ends up being a choppy, gentrified, soulless version of one of the best modern books ever written.  Really a shame and a waste of resources.
dvd||4.0||The Full Frame version is just that, the unmatted full frame of the filmed image.  The Widescreen version is simply the full frame matted with black bars to fit a wide theater screen (this is how it was originally shown in theaters).  In two spots the DVD lies about the Full Frame version, saying that it's a Pan & Scan trimming of the Widescreen picture.(1) The Widescreen/Full Frame menu screen which comes up when the disc boots up and also when you select "Video Setup" from the main menu.  This screen shows a screen capture of a film frame that appears at 19:46 in the movie.  The capture was taken from the Widescreen matted version of the film, and the "Full Frame" image displayed is simply a cropped version of the Widescreen image.(2) The text "The following film has been modified from its original version.  It has been formatted to fit this screen." which appears before the Full Frame version of the movie is played.MGM got themselves into trouble for this very same lie on their DVD packaging
dvd||4.0||This 1971 black comedy is still a stitch, even if it doesn't feel as audacious as I'm sure it once did. Directed by the maverick Hal Ashby, it is the epitome of all opposites-attract love stories as a twenty-year old depressive connects with a 79-year old life-loving woman. They actually bond over their mutual interest in death, as they keep showing up at the same funerals. However, the root of their respective interests couldn't be more different - Maude shows up to reconfirm how lucky she feels to be alive, while the hearse-driving Harold simply likes the morbidity of it all.The plot is really about their burgeoning relationship, while his mother constantly attempts to make the death-obsessed Harold more socially acceptable. First, she uselessly sets him up on a series of blind dates. To foil any hope of romance with these women, however, he stages mock-suicides which simply perturbs rather than disturbs his mother. She then recruits an ineffectual analyst and even has her brother Victor, a hawkish officer and Vietnam War amputee, to try to convince Harold to join the Army. The episodic structure of the story by Collin Higgins (years before becoming a director in his own right with "Foul Play" and "Nine to Five") allows the characters to develop in subtle ways with a completely deadpan approach despite the outward shenanigans of the characters' actions. The movie eventually moves toward a greater gravitas but despite some soap opera elements, surprisingly not at the expense of the pervasive whimsical tone.Ruth Gordon is her typically pixilated self, an archetype she played for years afterward, while Bud Cort is terrific in conveying his particular brand of wide-eyed cynicism. It's really their unforced chemistry that keeps the film feeling fresh 35 years later. There are funny sideline performances by Vivian Pickles as Harold's eye-rolling mother, Ellen Geer as an overly actressy blind date named Sunshine, and Eric Christmas in a very funny cameo as a disapproving priest. Cat Stevens' soundtrack hasn't aged as well as, say, Simon and Garfunkel's music in "The Graduate", but it still works as a folkish commentary on the quirky proceedings. Unfortunately, the 2000 DVD contains a rather compromised print and there are no extras included
dvd||5.0||Just as I remember it when it first came out in the eightys.  Good movie but got little recognition, my wife who is 10 years younger than I had never heard of it, but was impressed
dvd||5.0||Bergman first introduced us to Johan and Marianne in his 1974 masterpiece Scenes from a Marriage, one of the cinema's most exacting dissections of our all-too-human failure to connect.  Bergman and the splendid Scandanavian actors Erland Josephson and Liv Ullmann took us through Johan and Marianne's marriage, divorce, and post-divorce reconciliation.  In the end, they live apart, but still make room for the bond between them.  Three decades later, Bergman, Josephson and Ullmann have given us Saraband, a late-life gift.  Marianne decides that even though she hasn't seen Johan since the 1970s, it's time to make contact again.  Johan has inherited money from an aunt, and lives in splendid isolation overlooking a lake.  She literally wakes him with a kiss, but soon enough Marianne's fantasy of an idyllic reunion evaporates as she gets drawn deeper into the power struggles in Johan's family.Henrik, Johan's son, is staying in a nearby cottage with his daughter Karin.  Both of them still mourn Anna, Henrik's wife and Karin's mother, who died two years before.  Henrik, a music teacher, is preparing Karin, an accomplished cellist, for her conservatory entrance exams.  The elderly Johan remains cold-hearted but charismatic (not unlike Bergman's own father) and one of the questions the movie explores is why people are so attracted to him.  Henrik wants his father's affection and acceptance, even though Johan refuses to give it, ostensibly due to some slight by Henrik when he was 19 years old.  In a painful scene, Henrik goes to Johan to ask for money to help Karin, and in his 61 year old face, we see the bewilderment of the boy who never came to grips with his self-absorbed father.For Karin, her grandfather is a counterweight to the suffocating embrace of her father.  Karin struggles to figure out what she owes Henrik, what she owes to the memory of her mother, and what she owes to herself.  She lets Marianne see some, but not all, of the turmoil she's going through.  For Marianne, her attraction to Johan remains as difficult to pin down as it was when she was married to him.  She's always wanted something from him, but since she can't define what it is, she'll probably never get it.The struggles between the characters get played out over ten riveting scenes bookended by Marianne's opening and closing monologues.  Karin makes her choices.  Henrik reacts.  Marianne throws herself once more against Johan's emotional aloofness.  As he's done throughout his brilliant career, Bergman brings it alive through artful dialog, perfect dramatic timing, and riveting cinematic composition.  The characters are not always likable, but they are never less than engrossing.The Criterion's DVD includes a mini-documentary of Bergman making Saraband.  We watch the 87 year old director slump to the floor to illustrate some blocking, kid around with the crew, poke and prod his actors into position.  It's a treat to watch him work.  One wonders if any other director will ever elicit such an emotionally powerful performance from Julia Dufvenius, the fine young actress who plays Karin.  One also wonders why Bergman put himself through the grueling labor of making another film after he'd announced he was through.  Bergman spent his entire career obsessed by the difficulties of human connection.  Apparently he wants to say one last thing about it, which seems to be this:  after all the tears and shouting, all the posturing and cruelty, all the reaching out and pulling back, this is what remains:  marriages of true minds (the photo of Anna used in the film is a picture of Bergman's great love, his deceased wife Ingrid); the fraught ties of fathers and sons; memories of old loves; what you give and get from children; and the devolution of the flesh.  None of it is easy, the master tells us, but all of it is necessary.  In the end, it's all you have.What's truly sad is that Bergman, sixty years after embarking on his cinematic journey, claims that he's done.  He did for film what Shakespeare did for theater, took it to new levels by expanding the language used to describe the glories and follies of human striving.  He will certainly be missed and he can't be replaced.But don't see Saraband for nostalgic reasons.  It's a moving, insightful film that deserves a place in the director's canon.  Saraband stands on its own, but it's a deeper experience if you watch Scenes from a Marriage first.
dvd||5.0||Right after watching this, my wife and I called our (now) 14 yo dancer in to see it.  She in turn had her dance buddies watch it the next time they were over.  The look of amazement on ALL of our faces as we watched some of the best there ever was worth the price of admission.  Like the commercial says;  DVD player; $200, DVD; $15, Watching your daughter work ten times harder on her tapping-priceless
dvd||2.0||This is a wonderful film. Some may say it's a bit slow paced and perhaps it's not geared for the MTV generation's pace of visual stimulation. Nonetheless, patience has it's rewards for anyone who cares to take a  chance. It appears that every last detail in this film was molded by the  director, Tati. Unfortunately, the video transfer on this edition is so  terribly soft, as though the telecine was not in focus. It's a crime that  such a great film could not have been treated with greater care. One only  hopes that a DVD transfer of superior quality is in the pipes

Since it is a video that I could watch, pause, then continue watching it was easy for me to understand. The explanations made a lot of sense.

dvd||1.0||Flightplan, or "Flightpanned" is implausible posturing and shrieking. Its total disregard for facts adds foolishness to tediousness. You know where the movie is going within 20 minutes and just like a real plane flight, you spend the rest of the time waiting for it to end.It is a wretched mess
dvd||4.0||this 1988 gore film (i can't call it anything else since it's not a horror film in the classic sense) features an ensemble of Treat Williams {most notably from the "Substitute" series of movies} and comedian Joe Piscopo, known for his years on Saturday Night Live and stand-up comedy impersonating the likes of Frank Sinatra and David Letterman among others. The two play cops, Williams is Roger and Joe is his partner, Doug. the back of the VHS gives a detailed description of the film, plus two pictures of some of the scenes in the movie. Lindsay Frost plays the stereotypical "innocent" woman caught up in everything that's going on around her...but the corpse of the situation deals with Roger getting shot and coming back to life. he must solve a case within so many hours or he'll turn into ashes...and as the hours progress, naturally we start to see his body fall apart literally. Darren McGavin plays the part of an evil doctor. Vincent Price plays in a scene or two, and he's revealed to be the mastermind behind the Resurrection Room at the Dante Lab {he plays a guy named Loudermilk who everyone thinks is dead}. the movie is gory and off-beat, and it succeeds in being a good parody of the Lethal Weapon 'buddy cop' films even though it probably wasn't intended to be the first time around but that's the way i view it and on that point the movie is great. i give it four stars because of the gore and my personal dislike for gory/slasher films...but those who like that kind of film will LOVE this one. it's not so hard-core gore and so stomach turning it can't be seen several times...like many of the Texas Chainsaw films are...but "Dead Heat" IS gory compared to other action films of this era starring Charles Bronson, Clint Eastwood, or Mel Gibson. i give it 4 stars for the story, cast, and acting...minus 1 star for the gore factor
dvd||1.0||Let me start by saying if you are considering purchase of this film, make your own decision as to if you will purchase it. This is simply my opinion of the film. This movie has horrible fight scenes that don't appear to be martial arts at all. Basically, Van Damme is in another film which does not capitalize on his martial arts abilities, and forces him into a stiff choreographed position. They found some buff guys, okay, big deal. They put them in a film, and say that they are super soldiers with extra ordinary skills. These guys don't have that. Vin Diesel has far better choreography by himself. I have said this about other films and I will say it about this one as well. The cast & crew benefited from the production of this film, so it doesnt affect them. They go home happy believing they did a good job. You, the consumer, you go and see it on the shelf and recognize a star on the cover and consider buying it. Wrong move as for this film. You will waste money that could have been put into your retirement, or used to buy your children school paper as they educate themselves. Save that money and put it where it belongs. This is not worth your cash
dvd||4.0||Season 1 of "Millennium" featured fantastic performances from its cast and a dark atmosphere that made "The X-Files" look sunny by comparison. Unfortunately much of that year ended up as little more than a "murder mystery of the week" fare. Thankfully the second season, supervised by former "X-Files" producers Glen Morgan and James Wong, changed all that. The second season began with the suspenseful 'Beginning and the End', where Frank Black pursues the mysterious Polaroid Man who kidnapped his wife. This episode also introduces the comic relief for Season Two, computer hacker Brian Roedecker.Even though 'The Beginnning And the End' would fit perfectly in Season 1, the subsequent episodes follow a different path that greatly improved the series. Starting with the second episode, 'Beware of the Dog', and continuing with episodes such as 'The Hand of St. Sebastian', 'Owls', 'Roosters', and the haunting two-part season finale 'The Fourth Horseman/The Time Is Now', we find out that the Millennium Group has existed since the beginnings of Christianity and isn't nearly as altruistic as Frank Black (and the viewers) originally suspected.In addition to the Millennium Group storyline, we also learn more about Frank's childhood via two holiday episodes: 'The Curse of Frank Black', a Halloween-themed tale where Frank encounters the ghost of a neighbor who committed suicide, and 'Midnight of the Century', an emotional story of Frank trying to mend the relationship between him and his father. In the latter we find out that Frank was not the only one with a strange gift, as his mother was blessed/cursed with the ability to see angels. Lastly the second season even showcased two comedy episodes: 'Jose Chung's DOOMSDAY DEFENSE' and 'Somehow Satan Got Behind Me'. These hours of television are completely different from the average "Millennium" episode (to say the least) but they're still worth a look nonetheless.I could continue rambling on and on about the greatness of Season Two, but you'll really have to buy the DVD set and form your own opinions. The DVD set does come with some bonus features, but the only one of worth is the Season Two documentary "Turning of the Tide". The rest of the bonus materials are second-rate at best

dvd||5.0||I loved this movie. It was very touching and projected a wonderful image. It was a rare find
dvd||4.0||This is an excellent movie if you like war flicks. It made me angry being from the Vietnam generation also. It shows how pointless war is and what a waste of good men. The acting from all the cast was top class. I highly recommend this movie. It may be slow at first, but the action later is amazing
dvd||2.0||During my teenage years I was a fan of WWF wrestling and specifically, the Rock.  He was a tremendous wrestler who the fans admired right away because of his talent to be extremely funny on the microphone and cut some of the funniest, most disgusting lines ever mentioned on WWF TV.  His talent in the ring was spot-on, and the Rock would always give the people everything he had when it came time to step in the ring and compete.  He rarely made a mistake in the ring... but he made a HUGE mistake stepping away from wrestling and walking down the path to Hollywood.It's not that Doom is really a bad movie.  Sure, it was a movie considered a disappointment right from the get go because no one wanted to watch it at the movie theaters.  It's just a normal, monster-shooting film that delivers a tiny amount of suspense, and that's it.  I'm sure the movie would've been big had it been released 10 years ago.  Todays generation is probably sick of go-nowhere do-nothing action films such as Doom.  Okay, so it DOES go somewhere, but the film isn't really designed to build to an awe-inspiring creative story.  Doom is the kind of movie you don't really want to seek out- you just happen to come across it at the video store and decide you need a quick 90-minute action fix, so you rent the movie, watch it, and then forget about it the next morning.  Of course, I'm sure you don't forget to rewind the tape because that's impolite.  The Rock never should have left wrestling.  It was a bad career move and the millions of wrestling fans (and the Rock means MILLIONS) really miss him.  Come back home, Rock.  Please
dvd||1.0||This final season is just ridiculous...and not in a good way. When the Wayans abandon a project, then you know it is unfunny and over. Just look at the Scary Movie films.Kelly Coffield left because the producers wanted to use Alexandra Wentworth more. A huge mistake! Kelly was hilarious.Save your money and avoid this stinker season
dvd||5.0||Inliked the film in the theater and I like the film now.  The plot does not drag and does not bore
dvd||5.0||I have watched the first disk of the Tick, and I laughed my ass off!! I am working on getting a copy of it in order to send it to Comedy Central, and requst that they air the first season on their channel. I think that Fox screwed up by cancelling this show, and that Comedy Central should pick it up. It is by far the best show I have seen in awhile, and deserves to be resurrected!! Thank you
dvd||1.0||This show is my all time favorite, however Universal has gone and dicked it up by leaving out various sound effects and a teaser, and a wrong Season Premier Intro!DVD is meant to bring out the best in media, not the worst, how could they lose sound effects? Unbelievable! Just doesn't seem possible... SEASON 4 is no better...UNIVERSAL PLEASE READ THIS AND RE-RELEASE SEASON 3 AND 4 ALREADY, THE FANS ARE EXTREMELY PISSED OFF!
dvd||5.0||My 2 and 3 year old boys really enjoyed this DVD.  This Backyardigans DVD is their favorite so far (they have the 2 others Snow Fort and It's Great to be a Ghost also).  The music is lively but not loud and obnoxious like some kid's videos. It introduces kids to different styles of music and has great characters whose behaviors you don't mind your children copying. The Backyardigans are one of my favorite shows for them to watch.  
dvd||4.0||I enjoyed Ice Age, and this movie is good as well. Thankfully, all of the cast from the original Ice Age returned, and the comedy as well. And, besides the characters, the story is another original idea, and a great stand alone movie by itself, and thankfully not a rehasing of an old one.  The Ice Age is coming to an end, and Our gang rallies the inhabitants of the valley to go on a trek for Higher ground before their Valley gets flooded. Manny, along the way, begins to question his own mortality and the fact that He is "the last mammoth"...or is he. Well, that what everybody thinks, until they run across a family of opossums.  Don't see how Opossums and Mammoths tie together, just watch the movie. Queen Latifah was a good addition to the cast. Great film, one for the collection
dvd||5.0||As I have found with most Baby Einstein movies, this one engages my very active 10-month-old baby enough for her to sit for a period of time to enjoy. While I know that watching tv too much is unhealthy, she will not even give regular television a second gland (which I'm glad about). However, there are times when I need her to be more calm like when I change a diaper, try feeding new foods, and right before and after naps. These movies have been lifesavers to me. This one in particular is nice because it is introducing the body by identifying the same parts on babies and animals. I love to give her a bath and do the "head and shoulders, knees and toes" song with her and point to the different parts. She also loves to stand in front of a mirror and we'll point out our eyes, mouths, etc. This movie is a great introduction for babies and toddlers to understand their body parts.
dvd||2.0||I rented this DVD because of the glowing reviews here and because I wanted a better understanding of the origin of the modern problems in the Middle East. Overall, I was disappointed by this offering because it didn't give sufficient background and seemed to speak primarily to those who already had a knowledge of the subject. (It also seems to me to be *a bit* biased in Israel's favor vis-a-vis the Palestinians, but that flaw could be accepted and filtered appropriately.)For instance, the documentary jumps right into the last Zionist Congress in 1939 (or whenever it was), but they never define what the Zionist movement is or where it came from. I know some of this from my reading, but it would be nice to have a summary here -- especially as it relates to the main players in the rest of the documentary. I wish the documentary would have at least started with WWI and the British occupation of Palestine after the fall of the Ottoman Empire, rather than picking up at WWII and mentioning some of the WWI details later. Doing so would have answered questions like, "Why are the British so important here?"Another example is keeping track of the people, places, and organizations, which are often named in Hebrew or Arabic and are unfamiliar to the uninitiated. It made the sequence of events hard to follow because we had a hard time keeping track of who was doing what and where. Using more text on the screen, more maps, more recaps, and perhaps more English translations would have improved things greatly, methinks.The film certainly has value, not least because it is told by a participant and first-hand observer, but it is not for those without much familiarity with the people, places, and issues at hand
dvd||2.0||Thirteen Ghosts is about a machine. This machine was designed by a Man who was at the time possessed my Satan. Yes, Satan. If the plot doesn't seem stupid enough, it needs Ghosts to power it. Ghostbusters anyone? At the start we watch a ghost hunting scene with a ghost that looks it belongs in a Michael J Fox movie.  As time progresses you find out that the 'demonic machine' needs to be powered by ghosts. If done right, it opens the 'Eye to Hell'. Save yourself a few bucks and don't rent this.  It's awfu
dvd||1.0||I love bad movies, so when i saw there was a documentary out all about ranking the worst movies i thought i'd give it a try.Don't bother with this DVD.  Its 60 minutes long.  Now think about that fact. 50 movies, in 60 minutes. Some movies are barely shown for twenty seconds or they use a commercial that reveals little of whats bad in the movie.  SO problem number one they don't show enough of the movies.  Problem 2 is the bad designs of people booing and throwing popcorn at every movie they talk about.  The voice over was also a bit on the annoying side but thats probably the fault of the people who made this.Its actually very ironic that this being about the worst films is actually a terrible film in itself. Another complaint i have is on what merrits on they ranking these films.  FOr a few, it seemed they put their not cause they were the worst movies made but because they were box office flops. I'm not saying Ishtar or Howard the duck were good movies but they shouldn't be placed on a list of the worst.  There are alot more terrible films, with acting thats unbelievably bad, mistakes galore, poor lighting, poor directing, poor writing,etc.  These were just bad movies that were flops.  I'm surprised they didn't throw Heaven's gate in here if they were doing flops.So i don't get the criteria they were using.  A lot of really terrible movies were excluded too for some reason.  Manos is sadly missing.  Glen or Glenda is alot worse then Plan 9(despite plan 9 having the fame) yet plan 9 got a lower ranking.  I guess the best thing i can say about this DVD is that they did get a list of some very bad movies.  Robot Monster and Santa Claus Conquers the Martians are amongst the worst movies you'll ever see.  According to the DVD, only Black Belt Jones is a movie so bad its funny but many (If not all) picked are so bad they are funny.  I didn't like how they included the movie Troll only because the sequel Troll 2 was so much worse(For heaven's sake, Troll 2 didn't even have trolls in it.  it had Goblins.  Thats bad!).So, if you guys want to Watch a List of movies with barely any clips of the films that emphasize there baddness, this a film for you.  those of you who don't, heres a breif list of some of their movies.Snow WHite and the 3 stoogesGreetingsThe frozen DeadThey saved Hitler's brainBlack belt JonesTNT JacksonThe thing with two headsHoward the DuckBilly the kid vs. DraculaBela Legosi meets a brooklyn GorillaStrange CreaturesBloodsucking freaksLeonard pt. 6Attack of the crab monstersRobot MonsterSanta Claus Conquers the martiansTrollTrogXanaduThe Crippled MastersI married a Monster from outer spaceTeenage ZombieGhost and the invisible BikiniFat SpyPlan 9 from outer spaceGlen or GlendaBride of the monsterThe mesa of Lost womenVoodoo WomanIshtarFrankenstein Conquers the worldThe Creeping TerrorThe great AlligatorHillbillys in a haunted HouseThe incredible melting manFirebird 2015AdDracula Vs.

dvd||4.0||Few days ago, I watched the documentary "Z Channel: A Magnificent Obsession" (2004) about a channel that had brought the great and unavailable anywhere else films to its 100, 000 lucky subscribers in LA in 70s - 80s. While enjoying the clips from many Foreign and Independent movies that were the best part of documentary, I was able to recognize the movie that I saw many years ago in Moscow and still remember well, I could not only recall the title. I remember that the movie was Dutch, very erotic - in the raw, brutal, twisted yet beautiful and passionate way. Watching "Z Channel..." I was happy to instantly recognize "Turks fruit" (1973) aka "Turkish Delight" made by Paul Verhoeven in 1973. I checked with Netflix, the movie was available; I bumped it up in my queue and just finished watching it. My memory served me well - Verhoeven's early film is as naturalistic, earthy, brutal, erotic, humorous, poetic, poignant, and captivating as I remember it. Based on the novel by Jan Wolker, "Turkish Delight" stars young, hot, very sexy (and I mean it - VERY SEXY) Rutger Hauer as a bohemian free spirited and often cruel sculptor Eric and even younger Monique van de Van as his wife Olga, child-like yet as sensual as Eric was, "the light of his life, the fire of his loins". The film that describes their stormy relationship has become the most financially successful Holland's film that was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language film and was proclaimed by Jan Wolker a "75% masterpiece".There are not very many directors in the world that can create the atmosphere of raw sensuality as well as Verhoeven (of his Dutch period, especially). Verhoeven is known for uncompromising approach to his work, fiery temperament, and aggressive movie-making. Joe Ezsterhaus who worked with Verhoeven on two films said about him: "The guy is like his movies: brilliant, mercurial, very daring, perverse, a wonderful series of paradoxes and contradictions..." "The Turkish Delight" is all that and I love it but I can understand how its graphic sexuality, more than one disgusting and revolting scenes (but they had to be in the movie) and crude behavior may put off a lot of viewers. Be prepared, "Turkish Delight" is delightful but it is very intense and often not easy to watch.
dvd||2.0||It is hard to believe that the same team that made Gettysburg made this verbose waste of time.  This movie almost guarantees that The Last Full Measure will never be filmed and that is a shame.It was a mistake to take Stephen Lang and put him in the role of Jackson.  Jackson was considered, even by his contemporaries, a military genius but crazy by half.  The film missed the mark with their attempt to show his religious convictions and his devotion to duty.  Lang had him speaking in long winded prose that sounded like bad soap opera dialog desperately trying to be Shakespearean.  The prayer scene in the morning? PUKE!  It could have been a voice over with battles scenes or soldiers marching, or anything else rather than what became just a terrible scene.Most of the "women" folk of the south were equally sappy and long winded, and I hate to say it but I was glad when the too precocious for words overacting child died of scarlet fever I was glad to be rid of her.  Her scenes should have been left on the cutting room floor.  I get it Jackson was "such a warrior and a peaceful lover of children at the same time what a diametrically opposed individual" give me a break, I hate being force feed like that.  A better Director could have gotten the same point across quicker and more subtly.  Then there is Chamberlain quoting Shakespeare while all around him look off to the distance with thousand yard stares.  There is supposedly 4 to 6 hours of footage lying around to this film.  I would love to see it reworked by a better director into what it should have been.  A narrative like Gettysburg that goes back and forth between a few central characters in a logical sequence without all the ham fisted attempts a proselytizing and all the noblesse oblige.If you must see it borrow it, rent it, but don't waste money buying it unless it is in the $3 bin at the local dirtmart.Gettysburg is much better.  I actually missed Sheen and I hate that guy
dvd||2.0||In spite of the thin plot line and the volumptous semi naked women, the comedian Bernie Mac stole this picture!  He played his part of the low life, club owning, hustler with perfect timing and high humor.  He made this movie enjoyable to watch
dvd||4.0||This is one of the best sci fi films from the 70's--not to be missed
dvd||4.0||The product is a1 BUT why arewe penalised for late delivery in the form of warfage !!!!! Shurly this is wrong ??
dvd||5.0||After Spinal Tap, this almost sweet film seemed at first a letdown.  But like ST, it is right on.  These wonderful performers can grab a character and hang on to it so well that even when it's satire, it's real.  If you hate even the idea of folk music, skip it--or watch it to laugh at all those dorky people.  If you were there--I was--it's a real hoot(enanny)!  Sadly, here in California, they were to be found en masse at every local 99 Cents Only stores.  I realize this is not for everyone, but neither was Spinal Tap.  Give it a try
dvd||2.0||Though I'm still a big South Park fan, I do think that the quality of the show has progressively declined over the past three seasons.  This season has its standouts, most notably the truly demented Christmas Critters episode, but it also has incredibly lame episodes like the dance off and election episodes.  To make matters worse, Matt and Trey put next to no effort into providing any extras for fans who pony up top dollar for the dvd collections.  A show like the Simpsons not only has more episodes per season and sells for the same price but the people involved in the Simpsons go the extra mile to satisfy fans:  full episode commentaries with writers, producers, directors, voice actors, etc as well as deleted scenes and other special features.  Matt and Trey provide generally uninteresting "mini commentaries."  No doubt about it, the boys are just generally "phoning it in" at this point, seemingly caring only about continuing their franchise and maximizing their profits for as little effort as possible
dvd||4.0||What happens when you title a movie "Mind the Gap" and lead the credits with Alan King? Few people under seventy become interested. But this is a great movie about life, relationships, and "the gap".Jill Souble is darn cute, and the overall acting good to great. King did his usual pro job too
dvd||5.0||To have these three classics for this low price is fantastic. One film is the 1938 version of the classic Christmas Carol this one starring Reginald Owen as a very respectable Scrooge. If you can refrain from comparing him to Alastair Sim, you will be better able to enjoy another interpretation of Scrooge, and it is a fine one. Owen is truly miserly and wretched, as befits Scrooge, and very believable. The overall production is wonderful, the only drawback was the casting of Terry Kilburn as Tiny Tim...WAY over the top, to the point where he is annoying. But all in all, a great version, and Ann Rutherford as the Ghost of Christmas Past is fascinating.Christmas in Connecticut is very satisfying; a real new England Christmas, with Barbara Stanwyck in one of her lighter roles. This is enjoyable for those who are alone over the Holidays and a great film to watch with family for those who will have a traditional Holiday, with family and friends.I saved the best for last...Boys Town.This is absolutely one of my all-time favorites, with Mickey Rooney in one of his definitve, cocky wise-guy roles. No one could touch a Mickey Rooney performance in this type of role; he cornered the brash market...as he proves in this movie. It is a real treat to watch him interact with Spencer Tracy, THE finest actor Hollywood has ever produced, IMO. He has dignity, he commands respect simply by virtue of his own quiet, firm presence.The other boys were great complements to the production; all very natural, and Bobs Watson particularly heart-breaking in his role; what a great actor he was! (If you can find a copy, see him with Cedric Hardwicke and Lionel Barrymore in "On Borrowed Time", a REAL tear-jerker.)I wish I could have been on the set of this one! They must have had a ball. When I saw it, as a child, I thought it was a movie, therefore fantasy, and not real; when I found out that Father Flanagan was indeed real, as was Boys Town, it gave the movie even more of a dimension and interest. His tenet, "There is no such thing as a bad boy", is touching in its simplicity and pure, simple faith. Father Flanagan's secret for success with even the most recalcitrant youth was this faith and his refusal to accept any boy's lack of self-esteem or belief in himself; with FF ALL things were possible.When Spencer Tracy was voted best Actor at the Academy Awards that year, he became the first actor to win the award two years in a row...the first was for his part as Manuel, in "Captains Courageous." Being the gracious, wonderful man he was, he accepted his award with extreme humility, and gave it to Father Flanagan, whom he highlighted in his acceptance speech.This movie has drama, excitement and some very funny moments and shows the amazing versatility of a very young Mickey Rooney. A truly great buy
dvd||4.0||This is the sort of sequel that should have been made in the first place. The premise is sillier than the first film (which was pretty silly itself), but the characters are appealing and the action is streamlined and intense. Enjoy the ride and try to forget that "The Lost World" ever existed
dvd||1.0||  I've been waiting for this season, literally, for years.  It contained (notice the past tense) the funniest scene ever in the entire run of the show.  It was in the emergency clinic in the episode "My Sister, My Sitter" where the scene pans around showing the patients.  Smithers appears holding an empty gerbil cage and is the only patient not sitting down.  When I first saw that, many years ago, I literally rolled off of the couch with laughter as my wife stared at me like I needed a padded room.  She didn't even understand the joke when I explained it as an alternate lifestyle practice of "hiding" the rodent so as to make sitting down more than a little uncomfortable.  This DVD cut has been cut and makes Smithers reply about not letting Lisa ahead of him make no sense.  One of my favorite things about the Simpsons was that they didn't care who they offended.  Well they went PC and now I'm highly offended!  If they hadn't messed with it I would give them 5 stars, or more realistically I wouldn't have bothered to write this review.  Quit tampering with the show, FOX!!
dvd||5.0||OK folks, this is by far one of the best DVDs I've bought in quite awhile. You get so much for so little. First you get the original black and white movie. Reefer Madness is like the Three Stooges, black and white just adds to its charm. But to see it in color is quite a hoot. The smoke is purple and pink, the suits and dresses are LOUD, and the color scheme for Mae's apartment is just mind boggling. What more could you ask for? Well you get more anyway.When I discovered that Mike Nelson from MST3000 fame actually had narrating duty, I just had to buy Reefer Madness again. He's hilarious. Sure it would have been great for his two robot buddies to join in, but who knows, maybe someday. Mike was right on the ball and I laughed out loud quite a few times. I never noticed before how much time the dope dealer spent making meals and eating.Well if that wasn't enough, we also get a short 15 minute film starring Grandpa Ganja. He's a marijuana expert who's been smoking pot for over 30 years. He quotes weed from the Bible, convincingly explains how Moses was a major dopehead, and also the disciples. Not only do we get an indepth history on marijuana, he demonstrates how to roll a joint, smoke a bong, and other helpful hints on how to administer medical THC. The old man is hilarious on helpful hints as to buying and growing your marijuana. When they showed the real old dude throwing marijuana seeds over his fence and then harvesting pot in his neighbor's yard I lost it. Low brow pot humor true, but in any case I laughed my butt off.If you already have a black and white copy of Reefer Madness, it's worth buying again to have this edition. It's well worth it
dvd||5.0||Other People's Money is a wonderful movie, full of smart dialogue, good music, and a terrific Danny DeVito performance.   DeVito is his usual funny, and easy-going self, while Gregory Peck is a strong-willed patriarch.  Very good stuff there.  The weakest performance is from Penelope Ann Miller, who isn't really convincing as the corporate attorney, but the material is so good that it saves the movie.  This is a 5 star film, however, it loses a 1/2 star, because of the last scene, which feels a bit tacked on.  Otherwise, a smart and funny film from the director of Moonstruck
dvd||2.0||I'm guessing that many of the reviewers are watching this movie through a haze of childhood nostalgia. I had not seen this movie as a child; those that say it's faithful to the book must have read something other than Lewis Carroll's Alice. However, the kitsch value is considerable; cheezy music and costumes, pure 1985. That being said, the Jabberwock was pretty cool in that "Godzilla-man-in-the-rubber-suit" sort of way. Also, the set design was very handsome. It's too bad that the lighting technology of the time couldn't have been more varied; everything looks somewhat flat and two dimensional. The film that comes closest to Tenniel's original Alice illustrations is the 1933 Paramount b & w version; it's not available on dvd but occasionally turns up on Turner Classics
dvd||1.0||What's all the fuss about. Ms. Hepburn doesn't act. Our leading man is plodding and mumbles half the time. Eddie Albert's restraint is utterly-unbelievable. Any two-bit paparazzi worth their weight in tin would have turned in those pictures for millions! What is Peck left with? A long life of knowing he's got a girl friend he can't touch, see, or speak with.I find this movie depressing. Hepburn chooses the stifling life of a princess for the "honor", instead of following the man she loves and running down that empty corridor screaming out his name as he walks out at the end, having chucked the whole royal kit-and-kabootle for her man. Peck choose poverty instead of instant journalistic fame? Albert takes one for his buddy and is now stuck doing endless pin-up photos in his dank drab loft? I mean really people. Would you like to live with the staff at the palace? Endless "League of Nations" speeches, and all the time wondering what the man of your dreams is doing? I'm sure she'd face the fate of Lady Di trying to escape her monotonous life. And to think she may even risk marrying someone like Prince Charles, a stiff approved of by her entourage. Depressing. Peck is forever seeing what could have been as no one believes a word of what he says when he finally comes out with the truth on his deathbed. And the only source he has is the former pin-up photographer down the hall in the rest home, the one who constantly mutters at the ceiling, "my photos coulda been a contenda" while taking pictures of nurses with his 1950 pinhole camera, the one without film they let him keep for patient management sake.Depressing. We should have heard a "WAIT" as Peck walks out of the last frame. Audrey running, her tiara falling to the marble floor, shoes flying off, holding her dress as the entire press corp chases after the both of them. They jump into the river again. Eddie, knowing she'd break, waits in a scooter and off they go into the roman sunset for a TRUE ROMAN HOLIDAY.But NOOOOOOOOOOO.....
dvd||5.0||Released during the "Just Say No" 1980s, this film is a cautionary tale of drug abuse.  Lenny is a guy just trying to stake his claim in the world, to make a little money. He soon impresses a big wheel  who moves Lenny and his wife to California where they are at first  overwhelmed by the opulence but then become willing participants in it.  Lenny continues to buy, buy, buy until it all crashes down.  When the money  stops rolling in, he is introduced to cocaine and the story then takes a  dramatic turn as we watch Lenny lose it all.  James Woods is fabulous as  Lenny.  I've seen this movie many times and now that I'm writing about it,  I think it's time to pop this one into the VCR for another viewing

dvd||2.0||Incredible does describe this movie- incredibly bad! This movie doesn't know what it wants to be. At times one can see attempts to recreate and milk the genuine rage and drama of "Mississippi Burning" or the anger and impunity of "Ghosts of Mississippi", or a hybrid of those and bits and pieces of other movies of this genre. At other times it looks like its just trying to draw from the sex appeal and cheesy interaction of 2 of its main actors, Matthew McConaughey and Sandra Bullock. As a result this movie picks up the rear in that genre's list of movies for lack of originality, and the scattered hodge podge statements it tries to make. Some of my favorite actors are wasted, either by being given cliched dialogue, over acting, or being put there merely for their brand name with no script to support their presence. If this script is considered a great adaptation of a great book, then I have no interest in reading the book. I'm sure the idea and the premise looked good on paper. But the direction doesn't guide the story with any coherence or identity of its own.  Bullock is mere cheesecake and is unbelievable in her role, proving she's only worthy of b-grade "Miss Congeniality" type crud.  McConaughey over acts so much (as can be said for Keifer Sutherland and others) that it can be said he balances out the under acting of Patrick McGoohan, Kevin Spacey and Donald Sutherland. Samuel L. Jackson should be ashamed of himself of not only his worst performance ever, but also easily his worst choice of movies to participate in.  Even the extras in this movie are horrible. Enough can't be said about the terrible direction in this movie, equating elongated facial shots with drama to a fault, making Sergio Leone westerns look much more authentic by comparison. This is not "a powerful film." It's a powerful attempt at using a big name cast, a brand name book and a capable director to use material that they know would easily jerk the emotions of its audience, and in doing that they resort to all the cliches of this genre scattering the story line in so many directions, culminating in an over the top, pleading hunk of cheese summation scene by McConaughey that wouldn't hold water in any real court of justice. Maybe people claim greatness to this movie out of guilt, or because they haven't seen quality comparisons and classics like "Mississippis Burning," that has both a great script and fabulous acting. I don't know. All I know is it tugs from so many hokey directions it takes the final scene to remind everyone how it started. Among the top of my most over rated movies

dvd||5.0||if you are a GHITS SAC fan this DVD is a must, series wise the dvd contains 4 new episodes and the tachikoma stories are back as well, in fact the tachikoma's are now back in action in the series Too. Graphic wise, 2nd gig drops the funny pastel look of the first season and returns to its dark look as it was in the first movie, the CG is allot more fine-tuned and the action is awesome!!!, the opener has also improved significantly for the series!!!, Sound wise the series is awesome as usual 5.1 DTS Japanese & 5.1 DTS English, with stereo for both and there are English subtitles if you chose to run it with Japanese audio. Overall they squealed SAC season 1 perfectly, this not a series to miss if you're a shell fan!   
dvd||4.0||I really enjoyed this movie.  Rose McGowan did a great job as the villianess Debbie.  My favorite line from the movie "It's a family thing."  The movie was, in my opinion, a black comedy.  And Rose totally looked like trailer trash on her first day of school--brilliant!  You should definately watch this movie when you haven't got anything better to do

dvd||1.0||Ignore the blurb on the VHS box, the movie is not about a couple's hot parties with hip friends, it is about a couple's awful parties with jerk friends. Now, that might not be a bad thing -- in fact, I think it could be easier to make a good movie about bad parties than about good ones -- but the advertising is dishonest.Much worse, though, is the the pointless and boring character of the movie, which is about a bunch of stupid or verbally sadistic "friends" who mostly don't like each other. While I've known cliques that keep getting together despite frictions between some members, it's inconceivable that these people would keep getting together for these abusive and tedious holiday events. Also, the couples' relationships, which come and go between these parties, are unexplained and mostly unexplored, as are some individuals' character changes, and indeed, almost everything that doesn't happen at the parties themselves
dvd||2.0||Well what can I say about this movie? Well one thing is: It wasn't what I'd expected. Those who'd seen the movie before told me it was bore and had absolutely nothing to it but I still wanted to see it. I was wrong and they were right.The movie is about a Zebra named Marty who wants to go to `the wild', bring in a lion called Alex who is self obsessed, a hippo named Gloria who is overprotective and a Giraffe named Melman who need psychiatric care. Marty escapes the zoo to go on an overnight holiday while his friends overreact and try to `help' him, but four get pinned in Manhattan as ferocious beasts and are shipped back to Africa. Along the way boat is hijacked by the penguins (who are the cutest characters besides the two chimps) and get stranded in Madagascar, meeting a dumb bunch of lemurs. That's basically the whole movie in a nutshell. The group fight, Alex returns to his lion instincts and they get back on the boat. End of story.The entire look of the 3D Animation was terrible as well. They should have continued with Shrek 3 instead of making this movie. It's pointless to watch.The most interesting thing in the entire DVD was the `Penguins Christmas Caper', which wasn't the short movie itself, but the man who played Patrick from Spongebob Squarepants is the polar bear.For those of you planning to buy this DVD, stay away. It's a huge rip off. It's just something to keep you waiting for Shrek 3
dvd||1.0||There is a pattern in Hollywood when it comes to drama/revenge films such as Eye for an Eye.  It is an extremely simple pattern that is regenerated time and time again because audiences like to not be surprised.  They are prepared for the bad guy to die at the end, whilst the victim or top-billed actor/actress comes out as the hero at the end.  It is meant to give us a sense of security and comfort, but for this critic it is getting old.  Eye for an Eye is a perfect example of film that falls deep within that tired genre of film.  From the opening credits of this film, you could count the steps that each actor was going to make all the way to the very end.  The pauses could be guessed, the lines could have been written the night before, and the acting was nothing short of mediocrity at its best.  It was guaranteed that the actors would be overly dramatic, the violins would always shrill around Kiefer, and there would be horrendously underdeveloped plotlines that would lead nowhere.  This is your typical revenge film with no excitement, no frills, nothing that would make it stand out from the rest.  The late director John Schlesinger played it safe with one of his final films, which will promise to bore and completely not satisfy you to the bitter end.Where did Eye for an Eye go wrong?  I don't think I need to count all the ways for you, but some of the bigger issues that I had with this feature was the complete unknown of the characters.  I have major issues with stories that escape realism to allow the main character to seem more dramatic.  What was Sally Field's job?  I know that is a small detail, but it better highlights my complaint that our central family (the McCanns) were not as developed as I would have liked to have seen.  I had no clue her daughter had a stutter until two seconds before her death, yet it seemed to be a bigger key element as the film progressed.  Ed Harris literally walked through his character, proving that Field's husband could have been played by a plastic bag and still seen the same level of emotion.  The only character worth watching, and was developed briefly, was Kiefer.  He was 100% evil in this film and it kept this film geek worth watching until the very end.  Yet, we didn't even know that much about him either (which upset me).  Schlesinger obviously knew the story that he was about to tell with Eye for an Eye very well, the actors I believe even knew the story and they probably didn't even need to read the script, and the story played it safe from the beginning, but it wasn't what I wanted to see.  I expected film like this to come out during the 80s, not in 1996.  It was pathetic to see name actors like Ed Harris, Sally Field, Phillip Baker Hall, Keith David, and Kiefer Sutherland walk through this film like it was a fly in the pan.  Nothing stood out in this film, nothing made me want to rewatch the brutality of it, and nothing made me feel excited about these actors.  This was a literal "nothing" film.  It lent nothing to the cinematic world except (and I stress this a bit) another peg in a very tired genre known as the "Revenge Thriller".After watching this film I said to my wife that I thought Sally Field was completely overdramatic throughout the course of it, overplaying the small parts and completely exploding the bigger elements, which made me think of a High School drama production.  It was amateur at best, but she said that is why directors use Sally, because she is known for being overly dramatic.  This is a pure example of a good thing gone badly.  Sally saw success with it once, but as she continues it only creates bad cinema.  There were times during Sally's bigger speeches that I found myself laughing.  I couldn't help myself, but her focus on certain words and clichï¿½ reaction to others just seemed cardboard instead of lifelike.  The same could be said for Ed Harris who obviously has discovered that he doesn't have to play the outlaying father any further in films.  He was completely wasted in this film.  Was there any emotion with him?  I didn't see any.  Then there was the pitiful contribution by Hall and David that begin with intrigue, but were dropped faster than a big ole sack of potatoes.  Also, did Mantegna take a class on how to be a one-dimensional clichï¿½?  Urg, his portrayal of the police office was a disgrace to those that genuinely play one-dimensional police officers.  Again, the only actor worth watching was Kiefer because he not only spoke with evil, but demonstrated that he was capable of anything vile.  It was his sole performance that made this film decent to watch to the end.  If I have to talk about the story I think I am just going to go mad myself.  Field over dramatized the entire film, thus creating uncertainty amongst the viewer.  Did Kiefer get a bad image because he was bad or because Field wanted to see him as evil?  That could have been a great avenue for this film to travel, but alas, ole safe Schlesinger didn't take us down that darker path.  I needed more to develop what Hall and David were doing at the support groups, but it seemed like that story was dropped rather quickly as the ending needed to be wrapped up gently in a comfort blanket for viewers.  This was yet another dark avenue that was not explored.  I felt as if I saw these dark avenues with the director and the cast, yet we chose to stay on the lighted path.  That, coupled with the poor acting, just created a film that didn't catch my attention and fully contributed nothing to the cinematic world.Overall, in case it wasn't obvious, this wasn't a good movie at all.  In fact, I could go through the rest of my life without thinking of this movie again.  I thought only horror movies had the stated Scream rules and somehow could stick to the same tired pattern over and over again, but with Eye for an Eye it became obvious that it the "Revenge Thrill" fell into that same pattern.  The only trouble is that horror films actually have fun with that repetitive structure, this film did not.  Sally Field was horrible and should really consider a strong independent film to bring her back to the spotlight, while everyone else was forgettable.  The only fun part was watching Jack Bauer play the epitome of evil.  Watch this film for Kiefer, but nothing else.  Skip it!Grade: * out of ****
dvd||4.0||CBS's THRESHOLD held the promise of a good science-fiction thriller; however regardless of it's interesting story premise, good acting, and well supported production team, it, like NBC's "SURFACE" and ABC's "INVASION", was cancelled.  Although I considered it the weakest of the three mentioned, it alone was told before production ended, it was not being re-newed; hence, it had just enough time to provide an adequate series finale and why I rated it 4 vice 3 stars.Was it cancelled because the plot was flimsy or dumb?  Possibly, but it did offer better tv viewing than many of the boob tube's "reality" shows and less than funny comedies.  Was it cancelled because it lacked character depth and good acting?  Maybe, but Carla Gugino (Molly), Charles Dutton (Blaylock), Brent Spiner(Fenway), Rob Benedict (Lucas), Peter Dinklage (Ramsey), and Brian Holt (Cavennaugh) did a very good job trying to provide three dimensions to their characters.  Sadly, they didn't have the opportunity to finish the job.Was it cancelled because it didn't get the support it needed from the folks behind the scenes?  Arguably, but the team did offer some great visuals, interesting plotlines, and nightmare scenarios.So why was this potentially promising series suddenly suffocated?  Probably because it cost too much money and the average television viewer doesn't appreciate a good story takes time to develop (The X-Files, Alias, 24, Law & Order, CSI, Smallville, Numbers, etc.).Is it worth buying or renting? Yes.  Though a cancelled series, it has that one thing most of it's one season wonders don't have--an adequate conclusion that doesn't leave you wondering how a cliff-hanger is to be resolved
dvd||2.0||I found this dvd to be very slow. There is only one workout on the tape and it is only 20 minutes long. Most of this time is spent talking, not streching
dvd||5.0||All Monty Python movies are a must-see. I think my generation has seen them all. I hope the younger generation (less than 40) watch at least one. The humor is at many levels, so the movie should be watched multiple times to soak it all in. This just means the movie gets funnier with each viewing. Like all good humor, it includes truthful commentaries about society and human behavior in general, as well as, politics and religion (without getting nasty)
dvd||5.0||Excellent little known movie with Viggo Mortensen as an F.B.I.agent under deep cover to infiltrate Japenese Mob. Greatperformances by all {Michael Nouri, a little over the top}great action and sentimentality when Viggos character is tornbetween man who treats him like a son and duty as an agent afterF.B.I makes deal with mobster Nouri to make a hit on the Yakuza
dvd||2.0||The editor decided that I don't want to see how the plane crashes into WTC, or how people jump from windows, so, he cut pretty much all of that and who knows what else. Instead, there is a plenty of news people's talking into camera about where they were at the time and what they were thinking (and why do I care?), plus a bunch of stuff about anthrax to pad the little footage that was left.
dvd||5.0||I really did; i would watch it almost everyday! It was my favorite movie back then! I held this tradition until... (sob)... my mom threw away our copy! I don't CARE if the tape was old! I still wanna see it! (I'm gonna buy it on DVD soon! ^_^) Fluke is a great movie the whole family can enjoy. It's an original story that should make you cry. It even has a pretty funny ending! I can't wait to see this movie again... anyway, this movie is about a man who dies in a car-crash and gets reincarnated as a dog--I know a lot of peeps out there that don't believe in reincarnation but just remember, this is fiction--anyway, as he grows older, he wants to see his wife and kid even more. He decides to find them. He one day sees them in a parking lot (and can't remember what they did, the last time I saw this movie was a couple years ago) and he ran up to the car window and scared his wife. She told him to shoo and after a while he got off the car and watched them drive away (i think). I sadly can't remember what happened after that but I know he goes to his house and his son asks if they can keep him for a pet. The mother agrees, reluctantly. I dont remember a lot of the rest but i know he meets another guy that was reincarnated as a dog and they become friends...and...uh...NO! I NEED TO WATCH THE MOVIE AGAIN!!! I just bought the book, so after I read the book, I plan to watch the movie. BWA HA HA~~!!! Anyway, it's a fun-filled movie. Watch it
dvd||2.0||I was a huge fan of the books growing up, and a lover of the period and Jannette Oke's books. I had greatly enjoyed the first movie and was eagerly looking forward to watching the next in the series. Well, I just finished -- and could hardly stop from yawning while I watched!  The movie started out well enough.  Wonderful filming, great costuming, glorious rolling hills and large trees transport you back in time.  No, the faults definitely do not lie with the production of the movie.The scriptwriting and acting seemed to have gone down a notch.  I remembered the tomboyish Missie from the last film and couldn't wait to see her older.  The actress portraying the older Missie just did not do her justice! While she was pretty, she read most of her lines flat, with little emotion.  The worst was the very ending, which was supposed to have been a heart-breaking moment between father and daughter, instead fell completely flat.  In fact, most of the scenes with Missie had me checking to see how much time the movie had left.I think there were several attempts to portray Missie as spirited (like her chasing the chicken in the restaurant), but to me they just felt out of place from the new placid Missie we were continually seeing.  Apart from that, the rest of the cast was average, with a few star moments here and there.  I can't remember the book very well to check for accuracy, but the story was so-so as well -- melodrama only reared its head in a few places.  Only if you want to keep up-to-date with the series, I would recommend this.  Otherwise, I'm glad they replaced Missie's actress for the next film.  Perhaps we'll get to see a more energetic performance.

dvd||1.0||This is my number one most overrated movie of all time.  We saw it at a pretensious artsy theater, along with an assortment of ex-hippies and wooly haired intellectuals.  They all cheered, of course, when the young girl beats the boys at finding the prize in the water, then becomes the chief.  The truth is that every single scene is utterly predictable, given the politically correct theme.  The truth is that old people are not bad just because they love their culture.  The truth is that tradition is not inherently evil.  The truth is that girls are no better or worse than boys.  Basically, if you hate men, this is the flick for you.  But it is not good.  It is not creative.  There are no surprises.  There is just nothing there.  As I edit this, it's no surprise to find so few people liked this review.  There are still plenty of hippies and politically correct so-and-so's out there
dvd||5.0||I enjoyed the first season and got it. Eagerly awaiting season 2. See it for sale overseas in the UK but not here? Tough waiting so long...sigh. I can do other formats besides North America but it's a pain. C'mon guys, I'd rather spend the money here.
dvd||2.0||This film is definitely not a masterpiece. I found it incredibly dry and incomprehensibly over-rated. Yes, the film was bleak but inexplicably bleak. To make matters worse, the main character seems to resolve her numbness almost out of nowhere. Perhaps I missed something gigantic because I was trying not to fall asleep while watching this drag on but I would not attempt to see it again. However, there were a couple of memorable scenes.  I would strongly advise renting it before purchase. Some people do love the film but I don't understand why
dvd||2.0||I was a fan of House(the first of the series) and so purchased the combo DVD set of House and House 2.  I watched both movies with a friend recently and we decided that while House is pretty good, House 2 is definitely the kind of movie you waste an hour and a half on.  It is really quite dumb, but some of the creatures(i.e. "catter-dog" as I like to call him) are kind of fun to see.  I would suggest skipping the second House unless you just want to watch a movie to see how dumb a sequel can really be;-
dvd||4.0||I first saw "Dragonslayer" when it originally came out in theaters back in 1981.  It was the first VHS movie I ever purchased.  It's very well made, an engaging story with interesting characters that you care about. It still holds up. Caitlin Clarke's performance is the heart and soul of the film and she does a great job.  I wrote her when the film came out telling her as much, and received a hand-written thank you letter.  I learned recently that she passed away from cancer in 2004.  "Dragonslayer" has action, humor, humanity, political irony.  And if none of those matter to you: it's just plain fun
dvd||4.0||What do I think of when someone says "Disney!"? Hmmm...kiddy films, girly stuff, princess(groan, we don't need more of that!), dreams come true and...cheesy?Yep, all of the things above are in Ice Princess, with some fresh twists. With the "mean rival" changed to "nice rival", and add "with hard work" after "dreams come true". I mean, look at Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella, what did they do to make their dreams come true, which is a pathetic one, to marry a prince? One had a 100-year beauty sleep and the other had a fairy-godmother to make her a nice dress with a flick of the wand! Casey Carlyle was totally different. I agree with people, that it's impossible that she can become that good in such a short period of time, which is one of the reasons I give this film a 4 and not a 5. But it's an improvement.The cutting of the skating scenes are beautifully done, and while people on IMDB say that they're to showy, it is true, but aww, come on, this is a movie, not a real competition, and everybody likes some nice ice-skating in movies.The acting is great, especially Michelle Trachtenberg and Hayden Panettiere. Michelle's acting is really good, and you can see the gradual transformation from geeky to graceful in her movements. Hayden Panettiere's acting is also good, but it's a pity that her character is somewhat bland and "Mary-Sue"ish. "Mary-Sue"ish would mean that she's almost perfect. She's smart, good at sports and extremely popular also. It is very unfair, because on the page I'm writing this review on, it says "Ice Princess (Widescreen Edition)~JOAN CUSACK. I know she and Kim Catrall or the ones with fame, and don't mistake me, the acting IS good, but Casey and Gen completely steals the stage, and in the place of Joan Cusack, it should be the names of those two.The soundtrack is wonderful, especially Reachin' for Heaven and No One. Delicious songs! And Reachin' for Heaven is currently competing with forty something other songs for a place in the 78th Oscar Nominations List. Good luck
dvd||2.0||This movie was a weak effort by Capra, who directed it, and the star, Gary Cooper. It's a good story, just poorly directed (Capra can't hit a home run every time). I found the acting very wooden and the movie seemed to just drag on and on. And no extra features on the dvd, at least none to speak of
dvd||1.0||This movie was so boring and stupid, I turned it off after about 45 minutes.  Maybe I had a poor copy, but I could barely understand what Paula Prentiss was saying -- and it wasn't because she was "under the influence!"  I ran it back a few times but still couldn't make it out.  From the other reviewers, it sounds like it got better but, if something doesn't grab my attention after 30 minutes, I say forget it
dvd||5.0||Unlike Marshall Fine,who wrote the Amazon review, I don't find the subplot in this movie hard to swallow at all!  Sadly, politically I believe many of our fine military personnel have been sacrificed through the years for political agenda, and I am not just talking about recently.  I am sure there are flaws in the movie, but I wasn't watching the movie for flaws.  Truthfully, military movies are not my favorite genre.  Having said that, I found myself up very late one night and "happened upon" this fine movie. I was mesmerized.  Tommy Lee Jones and Samuel L. Jackson were brilliant, but it was the short segment with the former officer in the North Vietnamese Army that riveted my attention more than any other scene.  Just brilliant!   I can't say more or I will spoil it for anyone who has not seen it.  Needless to say, I give it 5 stars because it is a movie that made me think, one I will talk about in years to come.  That's a barometer for my star-meter! 
dvd||2.0||... Tyrese Gibson, for WORST ACTOR EVER.  Up to this point, I've been a huge Paul Walker fan for his comedically bad acting.  He's made a career of it.  In this one, his impressive acting techniques involve the use of the word "bro" at least 75 times (to give his character street cred), and thoughtfully rubbing his chin during meetings with the other cops - it's clear Walker is deeply considering his plight.  But really Walker can't hold a candle to the absolutely atrocious acting of Tyrese Gibson.  My god where did they find this guy?  The movie would've been OK as a standard, mindless action film, but it really was ruined by the 6th grade drama club acting.Now you might be wonderning: who's the genius who decided to put these two together in a movie?  But wait, there's actually method to this madness.  Since their was no Vin Diesel, the director knew he had only Paul Walker left.  And it's well known that Walker cannot carry a film (see "Timeline").  So what to do?  Of course!  Find an actor EVEN WORSE than Walker and cast them together!  All of the sudden Walker doesn't look so terrible, because everyone's focusing on this other chump.  And apparently it worked, because a lot of people enjoyed this film, and there's even a sequel. 
dvd||5.0||First, off, if it has Pauly Shore it is pretty much guaranteed to be funny.  In this comedy, Pauly Shore and his buddy sign up to be in the reserves because they need the money, little does he know when he picks their area of expertise, water clarifacation, that it is something that will actually be needed and they get called into active duty.  Watch this movie
dvd||1.0||As much as I like Paul Newman, this movie is very disappointing once you've seen the far-superior film "Day One".  The portrayal of Oppenheimer and Groves is overly dramatic and totally unlike the behavior of real professional people.  The movie dwells on romantic side stories instead of fleshing out the history and science of the Manhatten project.Be sure to see "Day One" if you are interested in this, and give this film a miss
dvd||2.0||it seems like the actors didn't even read the book before they decided how to play their parts!  amanda root is terrible as anne elliot... overly timid and shy... captain wentworth isn't at all handsome or dashing... and when they finally get together at the end, it's so awkward, bland, and unclimactic you wished you'd never watched the movie because it so tainted the way you saw that moment as you read it in the book... some people might have liked it, but i definitely didn't.  to get an idea of the adaptions of jane austen i did like, i liked the keira knightley and the colin firth versions of pride and prejudice.  this movie could have been bette

dvd||1.0||I hate lawyers.What is a lawyer, anyway? Basically: it's a telemarketer in a decent suit, a guy who would be hawking the latest Ronco Hair-in-a-Can super-duper late night special to folks in Akron over his plantronic headset, only he won the genetic lottery and got shot out of an upper-middle class womb. Shakespeare said it first and best: "First, let's kill all the lawyers!". Former Enron uber-dealmaker John Wing put a little fast-times Houston spin on that one: "get all the lawyers in a room---and shoot 'em!---in the mouth, so you *can't* miss!" Exactly. Anyway, "The Firm" is a flick that purports to make the world of high-priced yappers jaw-rippingly exciting, so I was probably all amped up to despise it. But not really: back before I dug into a gig with the Dark Side in high finance, back when I was hefting a backpack over the sodden campus of my old alma mater, I briefly considered going into law: briefly, for about an hour. It was a desperate time, and I needed money. Why did I consider walking Hell's Highway, if only for an instant? Because John Grisham, boring lawyer-turned-ripping-potboiler-writer-turned-back-into-boring-lawyer, a kind of Tom Clancy for the paper-pusher and green-eyeshade set, made it all sound pretty damned funky (and lucrative! Hey, dig that BMW 7 series, baby, beep beep!) in his engrossing little novel "The Firm": granted, I've read better prose on the backs of cereal boxes, but it held my attention. I mean, seriously: you're 19, and the whole flying out on the corporate Lear to Grand Cayman and switching out briefcases full of cash sounds kinda cool. And strippers, man, plenty of strippers. Oh, and did someone mention a BMW?What's the difference between a lawyer and a snake? The snake at least has the decency to hiss before it sinks its fangs into your a**. Now it's true: Grisham writes like Kim Jong Il sings, but---in "The Firm", anyway---he was a master craftsman at moving things along at a bristling pace, from the pedestrian---hotshot Law School whiz kid gets picked up by a Memphis white-shoe law firm---to the Pretty Damned Atrocious, all while keeping the pressure ratcheted up with a dense, suffocating sense of malice. Grisham, like Michael Crichton, isn't a prose genius: he's not even mediocre. But he writes for film, and "The Firm" cried out for cinematic treatment. So it's baffling that, with all the right Stuff---Tom Cruise as winsome lead Mitch McDeere, Gene Hackman doing his chain-drinking Gene Hackman thang as the corrupt (but ultimately worn-out and pathetic) senior partner, and Sydney Pollack helming it up---that the big-screen treatment of "The Firm" is such a yawner. Talk about contempt of court.Pollack takes all that intricately woven little Grisham-plot and barfs big ugly chunks of it up on the screen. At its guts, really, "The Firm" was really nothing more than the Big Career Nightmare: I've bet the farm on this gig, I'm getting big money, I'm working like a fiend, my wife is having trouble remembering my name, and evidently I'm not doing tax-deals for loaded clients---I'm doing money laundering for The Mob. Pollack just mangles the whole thing, convolutes the simple, and renders up a flick that will have you checking your watch and yawning. Casting is part of the problem: Cruise does his thing, running around Memphis with his briefcase. Hackman drinks a lot and exudes pure Armani-clad sleaze: "The Firm" is all funny-wrinkles when he's onscreen, but hey, a man can only do so much. Jeanne Tripplehorn (Cruise's squeeze), who plays Lara San Giacomo when she's not playing Tripplehorn (seriously, google the two of 'em: astounding!) is a bitter old battleaxe who made me want to stick forks in my eyes. Wilford Brimley is just plain wrong as The Firm's security chief: too bald, too cracker, too rotund, too silly, too low-end, to do the role justice. Holly Hunter is even worse: Hunter is one of those eighties thangs who got pumped up as Something Sexy, which is baffling, given that she's about 3'8, and has all the sex appeal of an Oompah-Loompah. It doesn't help that she's a big, ugly Southern stereotype, the caricature most denizens of dumpy Michigan towns imagine Southerners to be. You want her to die: she doesn't. Pollack wants us to think she's clever and funny. She isn't. Ed Harris, I think, is in this movie. So is Hal Holbrook, which kinda ruins everything, because everytime Hal Holbrook is in a movie you know you're dealing with a bunch of friggin' crooks.  Anyway, the coup de grace to the stupidity is the entrance, Deus Ex Machina, of Paul Sorvino (Don Morolto---what kind of Goombah name is dat, anyway? Somebody call Tony Soprano!), who takes this juggernaut of boredom from the merely stupid to the totally ridiculous. If you wanna see Tom Cruise running around Memphis with his briefcase for two hours, by all means belly up to the bar. Otherwise, case dismissed. JS
dvd||4.0||Frankly, the idea of a Secret Service Agent having an affair with the President's wife is way out there in the first place. (Michael Douglas not withstanding).  If you like Keefer Sutherland (as in TV's 24) you will probably like this movie (his name could have been Jack Bower in  this flick too.  I thought it had good action, writing, acting and directing.  I would not mind seeing Keefer and Michael teamed up again on the same side.  I bought the dvd, but then again I collect movies for the actors.
dvd||5.0||One of the productions of which he is the most proud, Robert Redford's ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN should be required viewing (and the Woodward/Bernstein book should be required reading) for all who aspire to the profession of journalist.  Redford was fascinated with the story of two young, untested newspaper reporters who worked and worked and worked the story of the Watergate break-in until it led to the highest office in the United States.  Redford's involvement actually went back to the first news of the bungled burglary, so he followed as the story developed.  He got to know Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein when they were still at ground level, still unsure as to where this would all lead, but all three knew that it smelled of very big dirty politics.  Redford has always been a political animal, with a reporter's instinct, and several times he has been able to bring a story to the screen to illuminate the American political climate.  Earlier, he and director Michael Ritchie had made THE CANDIDATE, a very funny and acid look at how politics changes even the most well-meaning of men or women (and a film well worth your time).    It took two years of hard work to get ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN off the ground.  It was turned down by several studios, with the excuse that people were tired of Watergate, but he was finally able to get Warner Bros. to say yes, provided Redford himself would star.  Dustin Hoffman was enlisted to play Carl Bernstein, Redford's old friend Jason Robards won an Oscar as Washington Post Editor-In-Chief Ben Bradlee, Jack Warden was cast as Editor Harry Rosenfeld, Martin Balsam was Editor Howard Simons, Jane Alexander was Judy Hoback, bookkeeper to the Committee to Re-Elect the President (C.R.E.E.P.), Ned Beatty was Martin Dardis, who provided an incriminating piece of hard evidence, Stephen Collins was Hugh Sloan, whose wife Debbie (played by Meredith Baxter) kept his conscience working on the right side, Robert Walden (who would go on the the fine television series LOU GRANT) was Dirty Trickster Donald Segretti, and Hal Holbrook was given the pivotal role worthy of any spy story:  the mysterious Deep Throat, who helped Woodward along in a darkened parking garage whenever the trail led to a brick wall.  Of course, we now know that Deep Throat was the FBI's Assistant Director W. Mark Felt, an old friend of Woodward's and a man torn between his loyalty to the FBI and the need to shed light on some very dirty goings-on.  Redford asked Alan J. Pakula to direct and Gordon Willis to handle the cinematography, and they crafted a look that is part documentary, part thriller. (If you get a chance, also see Pakula and Willis' THE PARALLAX VIEW, starring Warren Beatty.  Another outstanding, scary political film.)  William Goldman, who won an Oscar for BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID, wrote the tight, exciting screenplay for which he won again (this was actually the fourth time Redford and Goldman had worked together; Goldman also adapted Donald E. Westlake's THE HOT ROCK, a very funny caper film, and the poignant THE GREAT WALDO PEPPER, which was out for a short time on DVD in Pan and Scan, but is now out of print and really should be seen in its beautiful Widescreen splendor.  Universal, where are you?)The efforts of all the principals to adhere to reality down to the smallest detail makes ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN a smashing success.  It succeeds as an exciting, suspenseful procedural, as a statement on the neccessity of a free press, as a character study, and as a great movie-movie.  The double-disc DVD set is the one to buy:  the first disc includes a new transfer of the film in crisp, clean 1:85 aspect ratio picture and sound with a very enlightening commentary by Redford himself.  The second contains three new short documentaries on the making of the film, on Woodward and Bernstein, and on Deep Throat.  There is also a vintage 1976 documentary on the making of the film, and an interview with Jason Robards on the Dinah Shore show.A deserved landmark in film and in journalism, ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN is a must-see and for all who aspire to what journalism should be, a must-own.  In our darkest hour, when all seems obfuscated and hopeless, it reminds us that light can be brought to bear.  People CAN make a difference
dvd||1.0||This is the worst version of 'Wuthering Heights' I have ever seen. Please, if you are a fan of Emily Bronte's classic, don't waste your time on this movie.  I don't know how anyone could try out for a part in a movie without reading the book it was based off of first. (None of the actors read the novel.) Instead, try seeing the 1939 or 1992 version, they ARE worth your time and money
dvd||5.0||The question at hand in the film Paradise Lost is not as much did these three teenagers commit this heinous act, but rather was there enough evidence to convict them for the murders. The answer, presented by material in the film, is an unflinching no. There was only speculation and rumor to convict the three.The film's strengths are that it doesn't preach, at least not in an overly wrought narrative, and it contains intimate moments with the accused and their families as well as the families of the victims. I can understand the pain and confusion of the victim's families. What is hard to understand is the bloodlust and need for revenge and retribution that immediately takes hold of them. The victims' families are the most terrifying aspect of this film. At one point the mother of the Byrnes child says in a hateful and spiteful tone "I hate them... I hate them and the mother's that bore them."Is there anything wrong with being hellishly angry with someone who has butchered your child? No, quite natural really. But the point of this film is that judgment was passed on these kids long before the trial even started. I imagine the Bible belt is a very scary place to be raised in... I'll have to ask Brad Pitt what he thinks about it some time.On the issue of the prosecution. They had next to nothing. A very questionable confession from a terrified kid, Jessie, with a 72 IQ, hearsay from a couple of kids who claim they heard Damien bragging about the murder but have no proof, a knife found behind Damien's house which doesn't match the wounds on the bodies, and the assertion that because Damien read about Wicca, he must be a Satanist.To look at the three kids is also an interesting aspect of the film. Jessie, a very small and slow kid seems a bit lost in the world. His IQ is low but he has no previous records of any type of behavior that would associate him with murder. Jason speaks in short breathless words and seems also to suffer from a low IQ. Damien is the key to everything in this film though. The defense made the key mistake of letting Damien take the stand for two reasons. The first reason is that Damien appears to have ADD and after the first 10 minutes of questioning he sort of fades away and answers in bland yes and no's. The second reason, and the most important, is that Damien is obviously extremely bright. Normally this wouldn't seem to be a problem but judging from every single person the filmmakers put on camera, smart people are hard to come by in that area of the world. Damien scared them.All of this adds up to the fact that there was not enough evidence to put these kids away and there were other, more sinister and shocking, suspects that needed to be pursued. The war rages on for the West Memphis Three and it is indeed frightening to think that they did it, and terrifying to think they didn't
dvd||2.0||While some critics can argue with Dan Brown's research and reasoning on certain historical points, one thing these Da Vinci "debunking" presentations will never be able to refute is this: the downplaying of the feminine role in western civilization and Christianity, primarily by the Catholic Church, and the fact that the Church still considered Mary Magdalene a common prostitute until just a few short years ago: 1969. Nor is it possible to refute the recent polymorphously perverse scandals that have rocked the Church after centuries of suppression and may have everything to do with the doctrinal distortions that Dan Brown has brought out in the open for serious review. This institution is in trouble because it is seriously out of balance with itself and has cut off its spiritual nose to despite its face by downplaying or denigrating the role of women as sacred beings and bearers of the Light, when their healthy presence is needed more than ever as a corrective to some of these abuses and scandals. Dan Brown has done the world a great service by showing how the feminine role in the divine was written out 2000 years ago, with help from Peter whose misogynistic views of women are plainly evident in the scriptures even today and are still, quite frankly, shocking and debasing. Sorry, but upon this "Rock" of male dominancy was built the Church.Thank you again, Dan Brown, by bringing these matters into the light of day so people can know more of their authentic history or at least do their own research to make up their own minds about which spiritual path is best for them and which ones were built on two millenniums worth of manipulations, obscurations and lies. These obscurations and lies happened through the efforts of a group of petty, insecure and misguided men down through the centuries to ensure their dominance and control over the masses, and they found a way to dominate not only the minds of the masses but their vast material resources, worth trillions, through guilt, control and other hidden but consistent abuses of power. And those of orthodox faith who continue to blindly support such hypocritical institutions have a lot more to answer for than any twenty Dan Browns put together. People are angry and they are angry at the failure of religion to live up to its own standards of behavior and for distorting what may have been Jesus' actual relationship with the women in his life--or were the disciples just supposed to be members of a exclusive Men's Club with Jesus as head and women as a species relegated to second class citizenship? To answer these questions, some of you will finally have to turn to your own heart and mind for a change instead of some literal interpretation of the truth, because not everything of the light is found in scriptures or on the printed page, especially after the scriptures have been selectively riddled with scissors for reasons of self-interest or from spiritual corruption. The next thing people should ask for is to have the vaults of the Vatican thrown open for public view. Lord only knows what plunder they contain
dvd||5.0||If there was ever a movie that exposed the hypocrisy and meanness in people, this would be it!  Mrs. O'Hara, beautifully played by Mia Farrow, doesn't trust Edwina, the new beauty that's come to town.  The two battle it out, with Edwina coming out the loser in the end.  Or does she?  If I said any more, I'd be spoiling the story.  Just watch this movie, and enjoy.  Things are never what they seem, and I promise the ending will be worth staying for
dvd||5.0||If you love Manilow, you will enjoy this dvd of a great entertainer. All the old hits plus  many new ones.This dvd is almost like being there
dvd||1.0||I cannot believe the black actor in this film is so sterotypical of the ghetto or uneducated image we've seen in films like "baby boy". Almost every line he had included a cuss word or n word. He didn't add a thing to the film except to be an annoyance. I don't know what this film was about. There are parts where there is a long silence with no talking. The whole movie was shot in the house with the exception of the maid when she finally leaves the house.There are a few scenes where the characters are running around  without any obvious aim. The film attempts to make the audience interested only to leave us saying, "what was all that excitement about?"
dvd||1.0||i bought this thinking that this would be fun and a decent workout, i tried it a few times but just couldnt get in to it. it go's a bit fast but i know i could get used to it, but they have very big steps and they lung into it and i think it would be better if they work up to it i kept finding myself rewinding it to do the step corretly i dont realy strive for perfection i just want to do it some what right. there are better ones out there than this, but i think i am going to try it again cuz it wasnt so bad that i am going to quit it
dvd||4.0||After buying the original "The Fast and The Furious" I found most of my enjoyment came from making fun of the movie and shaming it.  However, I can now say I am a fan of the trilogy (all 3 films are good).Lucas Black is simply The Man and gives another great performance here.  Bow Wow does a surprisingly good job as well.  Car buffs and street racers will especially like this movie (which I am neither).  This is a fast paced and exciting action packed movie that many will enjoy
dvd||2.0||Beware the reviews that say this is an underrated classic and masterpiece and all that.  Was real disappointed by 9th Gate.  This film is tepid, there is none of the satanic intensity/ambiance that you find in 'Rosemary's Baby' It's too Hollywood, surprisingly, considering the maverick presence of Depp/Polanski. Film opens well, with a suicide and Depp's opportunistic character who seems to straddle the moral fence, but it never creates the proper mood or atmosphere.  Exorcist 3, which I was equally disappointed in, at least was more satanic.  I won't spoil anything for those who do want to see it, but the showdown scene between Depp and those he is purusing is awkward and poorly directed.  Emmanuelle Seigner comes across more like a hippy chick than a Demona. And the 'showdown with the devil' is a letdown to say the least.  This film could have been great but Polanski dropped the ball, considering he was the producer/director/co-screenwriter, and the film fails in all three areas. It's not horrible, so I give it 2 stars.  But don't buy this film, rent it only.  Buy Angel Heart instead
dvd||1.0||Completey and utterly unfunny performances by Oldman and Roth. Stoppard may be a brilliant playwright but a filmmaker he is not, having botched a great potential for his play on the big screen. We get instead a literal and utterly uncinematic treatment of his much-touted play. Watching the first fifteen minutes of "heads, heads, heads, heads, heads, heads, heads, heads, heads," is colossal torture, like status elipticus. It's suited to the stage maybe but can never play well on the big screen. Having hopes it might pick up, that was dashed as the entire film seem to lack any momentum or any type of cinematic sensibility whatsoever. A classic blunder of failing to recognize two different mediums. Don't take my word for it, watch it yourself and see.
dvd||1.0||The only other FF material I've see is the movie and I didn't play any of the games yet so I'm not basing this review on that. After watching the first 3 dvdsand about 1/2 through the show i can say for me this show sucked.  The animation was bland and ugly looking. The C.G animation which was produced by GONZO was poor and didn't blend in at all.  (If you want good works by GONZO check out Full Metal Panic, Vandread, Hellsing, Gatekeepers and a few others). The plot was seemed to aimed at kids under 12. 2 kids and an adult woman get on a train in an abandoned train station that leads them to a different world. There they meet a strange man(strong silent type). Each episode goes something like this. The kids and woman get off the magic train at a strange place. The bad guy(kid??) sends his minions to where they 3 are. The man in black shows up(approx 7 min left in ep) and does nothing until the kids are in real danger then a light on his gun(attached to arm)turns on and he says "IT HAS MOVED??" yells "SOIL IS MY POWER" (cue in 2 minute transformation sequence where he puts 3 different colored shells in it and shoots ) a creature pops out of the smoke and defeats the bad guy, then he goes away. The kids and woman then get back on train and the show is over. That happens every single episode and there is very little plot development. Come on at least Pokemon has more of a plot. This show is clearly aimed for kids 10 and younger which from what I understand is not a big "Final Fantasy" demographic.  Strongly recommend a rental to see if you like it.
dvd||5.0||Moonlighting is one of the greatest series to ever grace television. Bruce Willis and Cybill Shepherd have a chemistry that just makes the episodes work. The scripts are well written, funny when they are supposed to be and serious when they are supposed to be. All I can say is you should check it out and see for yourself. I'm very happy I decided to buy these DVDs.
dvd||5.0||I really loved this story! Each actor played his role perfectly and the filming and special effects were outstanding
dvd||2.0||Surprisingly sleaze and Chauvinismby female Director Heckerling! Sheduplicated it in Chevy Chase vehicleNational Lampoon's European Vacationtoo! Many child actors got their starthere, but the thing that cracked me up, as I saw it when it came out (unfortu-nately) was the dialog of my fav band,Cheap Trick: Ticket scalper "...Themagntism of Robin Zander and the charisma of Rick Nielsen...and whatabout the tunes, 'I Want You To WantMe, The Dream Police...nan-nan-nah,'You're momma's alright, your daddy'salright, they just seem a little weird,Surrender, surrender...", before he's interrupted. If that isn't somebody'sidea of 'Surrender', they've stumbled onto this review by mistake
dvd||1.0||If your expecting a documentary with the clarity and production value of "End of the Century" or "Filth and the Fury" THIS AIN'T IT!  Picture taking 40 hours of bad home video (really awful sound) and editing together and calling it a documentary. No current interviews, No voice over making any sense of the chaos...No thought to flow or storyline, just a mishmash of stuff banged together. A real dissapointment. The saddest part is that for those fans out there who want it, this material could be a great source for a documentary with actual substance. I've liked the dolls for years and was really excited at the prospect of them getting their due. Its a shame this is what its been reduced to. Shame on everyone involved
dvd||4.0||This is definitely the best new anime series on the shelves.  The storyline is great, but this should have been the last DVD.  Things are getting noticeably dragged out at this point and what really steams me is getting only 3 episodes on this disc after paying over $20.  That's bogus.  DVDs can fit way more episodes on a single disc, and it's a rip off the way anime is being marketed lately.  The Cowboy Bebop series had 5 episodes per disc at the start, then dropped down to 4.  Now it's just getting worse.  At this point I'm starting to regret buying the Stand Alone Complex series instead of renting it.  I am going to buy volume 7 to see how things turn out, though.  Throughout the series I think disc 4 was my favorite
dvd||4.0||I love good underrated movies, they make you feel like you're part of a priviledge club of connoisseurs. I'm not a movie buff, but Deep Cover has all the elements you would expect of a classic : great acting, memorable lines, interesting ( and logical ) plot and a decent ending.Laurence Fishburne is at his best in his role of an undercover cop slowly crossing the line between pretending to be a drug dealer and pretending to be a cop. Jeff Golblum is one of those actors you either love or hate, and I loved him playing the dirty lawyer laundering drug money. There's a great chemistry between the two and the supporting cast, which to me, was one of the main weakness of New Jack City.The use of Laurence Fishburne's character as the narrator works wonder, and somewhere between the slow, dark wailings of the movie theme, the nightime shots of downtown LA and Laurence Fishburn's poetic lines, the movie grabs you into a world, an urban jungle, crowded with nightime vultures, heartless killers and hopeless junkies. Deep Cover is somewhere between Fables and magical realism, a place where reality exceeds fiction.A great movie, the DVD is so so, almost no extras, and the picture quality is good, without being great.    
dvd||5.0||If playwright Tennessee Williams's Southern gothic writing style makes his works feel more ornately melodramatic than those of O'Neill or his closest contemporary Arthur Miller, they do provide resonant showcases for the actors inhabiting his characters. This is clearly evidenced in this six-film, eight-disc collection that epitomizes some of the most powerful acting to come out of Hollywood in the 1950's and early 1960's, all directed by true filmmaking masters. Probably because they are the least censored by the studio system at least in the form presented now, the best of the set are Elia Kazan's "A Streetcar Named Desire" and John Huston's "The Night of the Iguana". The others are Kazan's "Baby Doll", Richard Brooks' "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof", Jose Quintero's "The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone" and Brooks' "Sweet Bird of Youth". A feral, smoldering Marlon Brando justifiably made his reputation as brutish Stanley Kowalski in 1951's "A Streetcar Named Desire", and his animalistic charisma still leaps off the screen. Intriguingly, one of the extras included in the two-disc set for the movie is footage from a 1947 screen test of Brando when he was 23, and his stardom seems assured even then. The plot of the movie amounts to the inevitable clash between Kowalski and his visiting sister-in-law, Blanche DuBois, a fading Southern belle on the verge of a mental breakdown. Having proven her ability to be a convincing Southerner in "Gone With the Wind", Vivien Leigh expertly handles all the florid dialogue with her particular blend of defiance and vulnerability.Strong supporting work comes from Kim Hunter as Blanche's naive sister Stella and Karl Malden as Blanche's seemingly respectful suitor Mitch. Now over ninety, Malden is on hand to provide his own eloquent recollections of the production on an alternate track, and film historians Rudy Behlmer and Jeff Young provide more objective commentary on another track. Film critic Richard Schickel's 1995 feature-length look at Kazan is the centerpiece of the second disk, and there is also a more interesting five-part documentary on the film and original Broadway show, the best portion focusing on censorship and the several minutes that have been reinserted in the DVD version of the film.1964's "The Night of the Iguana" deals with a similarly dysfunctional group of people, but this time the setting is a dilapidated Mexican beach resort where Reverend Shannon, newly defrocked, has taken a group of spinsters from a women's college. Huston made his reputation on his strong literary adaptations, and his affinity shows in the fulsome characterizations, striking visuals and dark humor. Richard Burton is in peak form as Shannon, and there is also sterling work from Deborah Kerr as the spinsterish Hannah and especially Ava Gardner as the slatternly resort owner, Maxine Faulk. The DVD contains a recent making-of featurette and a vintage video, both fascinating."Baby Doll" is an entertaining hoot that doesn't seem as sensationalistic as I'm sure it was when the film was first released in 1956. It's simply a Southern-fried farce about the potential deflowering of a nineteen-year old child bride with a nice, pouty turn by Carroll Baker in the title role and a surprisingly funny one by Karl Malden as her randy husband, cotton mill owner Archie. 1958's "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof" is far more vaunted but ultimately hamstrung by the overly careful portrayal of Brick as an asexual protagonist, this in spite of stellar performances from Elizabeth Taylor, Paul Newman and Burl Ives.Newman is even better as gigolo Chance Wayne in 1963's "Sweet Bird of Youth", and he is matched all the way by Geraldine Page's all-cylinders-on performance as faded movie queen Alexandra Del Lago (a role that would have ironically been ideal for Ava Gardner). The weakest film of the set is 1961's "The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone" about an aging American actress living in Rome who falls recklessly in love with an indifferent gigolo. A decade after "Streetcar", the glamorous-looking Leigh excels in the title role, while a young Warren Beatty fits the physical requirements as the gigolo Paolo even though his faux-Italian accent is a little too emphatic. All four of these movies come with making-of featurettes and original trailers, and "Cat" also includes commentary from Williams' biographer Donald Spoto.The focal point of the eighth disc is a 1973 documentary, "Tennessee Williams' South", which highlights insightful interviews with Williams in the New Orleans area. The film also includes classic scenes from his plays reenacted specifically for the documentary. You can have the privilege of seeing Broadway's original Blanche DuBois, Jessica Tandy, and compare her work to Leigh's, as well as an impressive turn by Maureen Stapleton as Amanda Wingfield in "The Glass Menagerie". This is an incredible film collection for anyone who wants to see some of the greatest performances of mid-20th century American cinema
dvd||2.0||The Forgotten starring Julianne Moore and Domnic West is a slow, tepid, and hard to grasp film. The previews for this film were better than the actual movie, I guess that's a bad sign that the movie isn't going to be great (I'll try and remember that next time). The only reason I am giving The Fogotten 2 stars is the scene with Alfe Woodward, you'll know what I mean when it happens, the scence is scary and comes out of nowhere, very intrguing spurprise awaits. Anyways The Forgotten is a movie you should see once and that's it, happy viewing
dvd||2.0||I was really looking forward to this, I've seen Cheap Trick live, and they really put on a good show. I don't know how some of the other reviewers can give this 5 stars for audio. It is like listening to a concert in an empty warehouse - muffled audio, and underpowered vocals.   I have a 5.1 home system and this is probably the worst sounding concert DVD that I've ever heard. I'm giving it 2 stars because I think it was a good show to see live (if you were there), but the audio quality (or lack of it) ruined it for me
dvd||4.0||A very good film staring Cary Grant and Grace Kelly. Cary plays the part of a retired jewel thief. Someone begins to steal jewels and the local police think its Cary. Grace plays the part of the daughter of a rich Amrican widow. The film then covers how Cary Grants  finds the people who have copied his MO.A fun romp through the French country side. Well acted and directed. A must see if you are a Cary Grant or Grace Kelly fan.                                                  jame
dvd||5.0||I'm not a big fan of Tom or Demi, and Jack even wears out his welcome in some films, but not here. The supporting roles are superbly done, the tension in the plot is sustained well until the end, and when this shows up on cable TV I almost always watch it again for a half-hour or so. Here you find soldiers and the law and political correctness in conflict, and that reflects a lot of real life in the USA during the past four years. I enjoy the script, because it demonstrates how brain power sometimes wins out over brute force. 
dvd||2.0||This has not aged well. The scripts are silly, the acting is of the "chewing up the scenery" variety. Gale Storm no longer seems cute; she comes across as annoyingly perky. Spend your money on something else
dvd||4.0||What's not to like about Richard Farnsworth? He was one of the few actors that received nothing but compliments during his acting days, an extremely likable "old man." Hey, few people every remember seeing this guy as anything but old, since he spent his younger days as a stuntman, rather than as an actor.So, he was a very good choice to portray a likable thief: Bill Miner, the last of the stagecoach and train robbers. "The Gentleman Bandit," I believe, was his label. This is a nice low-key adventure, with almost no bad language and the British Columbia and Washington state scenery is absolutely gorgeous. It would look great on widescreen DVD. What's the holdup? (pun intended)The only bad news of this tale is the usual filmmakers' twisted message to root for a man who simply was a crook, nothing else. The film also - especially to get the younger audience - needs more action. It will be too slow for them, but I liked it, if for no other reason that I can listen to Farnsworth's voice all night. What a "cool" guy he was, and it''s always a pleasure to see him on screen. 
dvd||5.0||This show undoubtly is one of the greatest around.  I have to say right off though to the guy in the first review about how they wanted to give American's their own Monty Python show and they failed because their show is BETTER than Monty Python.  Their show is not BETTER, it is of equal and noteworthy standing.  Monty Python is history that will never been changed.  They have gone on to do many other creative things.  Bob Odenkirk is doing Miller Lite commercials and I hope he does something like David has with his new appearance in Arrested Development.  I can honestly say that this show is not better, yet it is close, to Monty Pythons Flying Circus.  Both are great shows. It is full of hillarious sketches and original ideas that is for sure and if you haven't yet, go buy the other seasons and add to your growing comedy sets because you won't regret adding this
dvd||1.0||I saw this movie in a trip and it is one of the worst movies I have seen during the last two years. Stupid, stupid and stupid. Ryan Reynolds becomes annoying.If you have brain, never watch this movi
dvd||1.0||ALL THESE SHOWS ARE THE SYNDICATED ONES.THERE ARE AT LEAST 3 MIN CUT FROM EACH SHOW.SONY SUCKS BIG TIME FOR RELEASING EDITED SHOWS. NOT THE FIRST TIME( SEE SOAP,OTHER SEASONS OF GOOD TIMES).BROUGHT MINE BACK AND GOT A REFUND
dvd||2.0||Not my type of humor. I think I'm just too old to find the sophomoric comedy entertaining
dvd||1.0||Good grief - yet another DVD collection we are not buying because Disney doesn't seem to understand.  We LOVED these series when they were on television but we will not buy something that is slapped together and incomplete.  I hope the folks at Disney get the message eventually.  Same thing applies to their live action feature films.  Disney should release them in widescreen with some extras or not bother.  Too bad because we have all the animated films and would happily buy the live action if the same care was given to the production
dvd||4.0||Sure, I could have compared Phantom Quest Corp. to a lot of other animes out there, but the basic premise is the same -- we get a group of people who are working together to solve sci-fi mysteries...and there is definitely nothing wrong with that.A friend of mine introduced me to this series, and I must say that I was pleasantly surprised overall.If you love having vampires and mummies, among other things, show up in your anime, along with a HUGE dosage of humor to boot, then you will absolutely LOVE this show -- it manages to take dark subject matter and make it into something comical.I think the biggest weakness in this series is definitely a coherent side story -- it seems like things are a little too hashed together at times, and a little too rushed. On top of that, half of the Phantom Quest team only shows up when actually needed to do something, such as the team exorcist and the fortune teller -- neither of these two characters really gets a strong introduction at all.One more weakness would really be in the music as well, which I found continuously grating on my nerves -- mainly, the theme song. Most of the other music is just merely OK.Complaints aside, this is definitely worth your time, especially for such a small price -- buy this one, you certainly won't regret it
dvd||4.0||In the same way he was able to extract a searing performance from Andy Griffith in 1957's "A Face in the Crowd", master director Elia Kazan gets similarly stellar results from Natalie Wood in this classic 1961 melodrama about youthful sexual repression in rural 1920's Kansas. In the same year as her Maria in "West Side Story", she has never been more affecting then she is here as Deanie Loomis, the local butcher's daughter deeply in love with Bud Stamper, the son of an oil scion and the high school football hero. They are the senior sweethearts everyone expects to marry, but both have to battle constantly with their sexual longing and their grasping parents.The ruling moral code restricts Deanie more than Bud who ends up cavorting with a good-time girl named Juanita. The indiscretion overwhelms Deanie who attempts suicide and ends up in a sanitarium for her fragile mental state. A few years later with their lives on divergent paths, they meet again to come to terms with each other. While the whole film is beautifully executed thanks to Kazan's sure hand and William Inge's screenplay (his first directly for the screen), it's the last fifteen minutes that really resonate with the characters expressing their emotions with a minimum of dialogue. Otherwise, there are plenty of heated moments of melodrama along with soap opera elements familiar to anyone who has seen 1955's "Picnic" based on Inge's successful Broadway play.At her most beautiful, Wood is wondrous as she moves fluidly from innocently infatuated to obsessive to resigned. As the none-too-bright Bud, Warren Beatty is charismatic in his film debut and makes Deanie's powerful fixation completely understandable. There are several standout performances among the supporting cast with Audrey Christie pitch-perfect as Deanie's unsympathetic mother, Pat Hingle in blowhard mode as Bud's power-hungry father, and Zohra Lampert as Angie, the self-effacing waitress Bud meets at Yale. The classic Wordsworth poem from which the film's title is derived makes a fitting coda for this movie, and I still feel the intractable sense of longing in the two lead characters every time I see this movie. The 2001 DVD unfortunately has no extras

dvd||4.0||I did not see John Carpenter's original version of "Assault on Precinct 13," but that did matter to my enjoyment of the 2005 remake. I was paying attention so I knew what the set up was, both inside and out of the precinct, as we went along. But being ahead of the characters on this one does not do you much good because there are ample twists in James DeMonaco's script (I made the mistake of announcing right before the first assault the two characters I was sure would survive all the bullets and I was half-right, which is a polite way of saying I was half-wrong). It is New Year's Eve in Jean-Francois Richet's film and it has started to snow heavily. Precinct 13 officially closes at the stroke of midnight and filling up the last boxes are Sergeant Jake Roenick (Ethan Hawke), who has been hiding behind a desk ever since an undercover gig went horribly bad and he was wounded while his two partners were killed, grizzled veteran Jasper O'Shea (Brian Dennehy) who is always talking about retirement, and secretary Iris Ferry (Drea de Matteo) who is always talking about sex with bad boys. Jake would rather talk about sex than his feelings about what happened before with Alex Sabian (Mario Bello), the department shrink who happens to stop by on a snowy New Year's Eve to take another crack at Jake's psyche. Then a Detroit police transport bus shows up with a quartet of prisoners, unable to get to the prison because of the storm and a highway accident. There is Beck (John Leguizamo), who will not shut up, Anna (Alisha Hinds) a girl with a crew-cut who proclaims her innocence, Smiley (Ja Rule), a counterfeiter, and Marion Bishop (Laurence Fishburne), the most notorious criminal in the city, who has just been arrested for murdering an undercover cop under suspicious circumstances. So when a couple of guys with guns break into the precinct and everybody is yelling these are Bishop's men coming to get get, we do not buy it. After all, as soon as Bishop saw them he hid behind a wall. Things are just beginning to get interesting. "Assault on Precinct 13" is an action film where the human element is really more interesting once Jake figures out that to survive the night he needs everybody to help out, which means not only the prisoners but the women. Everybody gets a gun in this one, but you know full well that not everybody can be trusted with one. Furthermore, Jake is fully aware that Bishop is the smartest and deadliest person there, but this movie is all about making the best of a bad situation that keeps getting worse. The death of one character really puts the way this is going to play out into question, and I liked the note on which the film actually ends once we finally get down to the inevitable confrontation between the two main characters. Not great, but certainly an enjoyable action picture with a minimum amount of stupidity on the part of the characters once you accept the idea the die is cast and it is all or nothing for the bad guys. That is a pretty good recommendation for this genre
dvd||5.0||Excellent, great camera work, very good sound and commentar
dvd||1.0||I don't know how this skunk got 4 and 1/2 stars on Amazon let alone one!  I could hear Hepburn, Bogart and Holden rolling over with a resounding boom.  I think this is mainly because of Ford's Linus.  He is a very unsympathetic character in this remake.  The film critics said that, while the original Sabrina was about her transformation, this version was about Linus' transformation.  But here Linus shows no transformation that you can really see.  His explanation to Sabrina for his deceitful romancing at the end- "There was a merger, and you were in the way.  No hard feelings" is very cold compared with Bogart's "Would you believe I enjoyed every minute of it?"  In the original, you get the feeling that Sabrina gets the right man; you don't get that here at all
dvd||2.0||Wuthering Heights the novel grabs you at the first page and drags you through passion, betrayal, madness, despair, greed, hatred, and revenge. It's not necessarily a pleasant read, but always an engrossing one. Emily Bronte's characters jump off the page and will continue to haunt you long after you've finished the book. Modern day moviemakers have had a notoriously bad time translating any of the Bronte sisters' works into film and this is no exception. The characters are representations in name only and fail to capture any of the true spirit behind this amazing book. Juliet Binoche and Ralph Fiennes are two of the best actors working in film today, but this movie is a definite low point for both.  As Heathcliff and Catherine, Fiennes and Binoche seem to have failed to grasp the depth or the passions of the characters and their performances are flat and bland. Binoche's personality is too grounded and mature for the wild and carefree Cathy so she compensates with endless giggling that got on my nerves. Fiennes comes across as greasy and sullen instead of a tormented and complex soul; he simply does not have the charisma or the depth to play such a demanding role. The other characters are likewise lacking in realism, only Janet McTeer fares well, she is fabulous as Ellen Dean. Even if the acting were better, the story does not capture the essence of the book. Everything moves too quickly, the film jumps around frequently and large plot holes are left either unexplained or are patched quickly with a few brusque words. Sinead O'Conner's appearance as Emily Bronte to bookend the film is contrived and unnecessary.This film was very obviously made on a budget and the sets and costumes show it. The wigs are dreadful and the costumes are for the most part, ugly and unflattering. Fiennes actually looks potbellied in some of his vests! Maybe someday someone will make a film that does this remarkable book justice. This isn't it
dvd||5.0||I owned this movie in full screen on VHS. The quality of the transfer of "Apollo 13" with the wide screen and the incredible clearity 0f HD that was never possible before, makes this movie a true cinematic experience. One of Tom Hanks' best movies!. Since we're revewing here the HD version, I own a new Samsung 61" HDTV and the Toshiba HD-A1 ($399 from Amazon). An incredible improvement over my 1998 60" Standard Sony TV. If you have the right setup, it is the true home theater dream that we all hoped for since the dawn of home video back in the late 70's or early 80's. Be sure you use the HDMI cable or at least component connection. The audio track is also Great! With the right Dolby Digital/Plus 5.1 receiver/Speaker/Placement.Also, lots of Extras on the NTSC US version, including interviews with Hanks and some of the real astronauts
dvd||5.0||I love Sandra Bullock movies.  In this movie she is so innocent and falls in love with a man she has never spoken to but saves his life on the CTA.  In the time that he is still in a coma his family, thinking she is their son's fiancee, fall in love with her.  She inadvertantly falls in love with his brother.  I jus love the Cinderella story line.  She is fantastic as well as the family and especially Bill Pullman
dvd||4.0||Hector Elizondo is an actor of uncommon skill.  Aside from his superlative work as a Doctor on "Chicago Hope" he has been often cast as a sideman in films - the trusted aide, the sympathetic boss - but often in supporting roles.  In "Tortilla Soup" he takes the leading role in a Mexican-American remake of Ang Lee's "Eat Drink Man Woman".   He plays Martin Naranjo, a Mexican Chef so gifted that all who eat his cuisine proclaim him an artist.  The movie has delightful flourishes where we see dishes being prepared, then eaten, that are so delightful that you can almost perceive the wonderful aroma leaping from the screen.  Martin is has lost much of his sense of taste, which he thinks is a cruel irony, but his Cuban partner reminds him that Beethoven composed his greatest symphonies after he had lost the sense of hearing.  Martin also has 3 daughters who he has raised sinced becoming a widower 15 years ago.  Elizabeth Pena is Leticia, the pious schoolteacher who is invited to ask the blessing prior to the family meals although she turns a simple "grace" into mini-sermons.  Jacqueline Obradors is the saucy Carmen, who was encouraged to get her MBA by Martin, but has difficulty balancing the borderline ethics of large business deals with her growing realization that she is not pursuing her passion - as her father did with his wondrous cooking.  Tamara Mello is the youngest Maribel who finds herself torn between the pressure to go to college and to "find herself".  Constance Marie is family friend Yolando, who is the same age as the older sisters and is coming to the end of a dissatisfying marriage with a young daughter who Martin dotes on.  Raquel Welch is Yolando's mother, Hortensia, who is also without a man and plainly has designs on the compassionate and accomplished Martin.   The film depicts the evolution of these various characters as they come to terms with the progression of their love lives and professions.  At the beginning of the film all of the characters are single.  By the end they've all been paired off in one manner or another, some in a manner more satisfyingly realistic than others.  Raquel Welch is a bit of a distraction in the film.  At age 61 she has a show-stopping beauty that few woman would aspire to at age 25.  In a film full of attractive performers she doesn't "look her age" enough to blend into the story.  She plays the part of geriatric bombshell jester and in a nice ensemble this role sticks out like a geriatric bombshell jester. The movie otherwise has some realistic and positive things to say about aspirations and relationships and I would recommend it if only to watch Hector Elizondo around the dinner table and in the kitchen.
dvd||1.0||Whatever ills are in the world, it's all the fault of the corporations. That's the basic premise of this terribly misguided one-sided and totally non-objective movie. For example, instead of saying how terrible it is for companies paying people in the developing world peanuts for their work, they forget that these people's alternatives ARE EVEN WORSE and that's why they took that job in the first place!  These jobs provide them with one of the few options they have and, if they chose that job freely, it must be their BEST option, no matter how crazy it seems to us. As people's skills rise, as opportunities increase over time (by having MORE corporations and not less, to create more competition for these people's labor), and as the country becomes wealthier, these people's wages will rise automaticaly and in fact, the wages of the whole country on the average.  There are no shortcuts to his.  A famous story comes from Nepal where anti-child labor laws, at the urging of the UN, turned thousands of kids overnight into prostitutes as those jobs, as sad as it may be, were their best options to avoid starvation and feed their families.  It's a slow process, but all the industrialized nations went through that process.  Government-mandated "shortcuts" usually produce results which are even worse.  However, the results speak for themselves: in VERY short period of time, for example, HUNDRDS OF MILLIONS of people were lifted out of poverty in China, India and around the world thanks for the "evil" capalism & its corporations.  No other system has ever done it so quickly as in the past 15 years in China and India alone.  Also, cost of living is very low there, so these pennies really can go a long way, don't measure it to the cost of living in the West.  What is the filmmakers alternative they offer for these people? I guess to let people starve to death, then the makers of this movie don't have have anyting to complain about!?  Other examples of stupidity include showing that a company is like a person who's a psychopath.  A corpoartion is a legal entity yes, and may act like a separate "being" as far the law in concerned, but does a corporation have a nose, feet, stomach? Can it eat apples or sneeze or have arthritis? Of course, not, than how can you attach a human idea like a psychopath to it??  Several of the main "spokepersons" in the movie, Chomsky, Michael Moore, Rifkin and others are renowned for their off-the-wall comments which frequently have NO basis in any kind of economics or reality.  To correct the inaccuracies in the statements made by these and other people in the movie, you'd have to stop it every 5 minutes and explain to the audience how profoundly wrong the statements are.  Throughout the whole movie, you're basically bombarded by one-sided arguments with VERY little of the other side presented, despite the director's claim of the opposite 9they claim 1/2 & 1/2, it's more like 80%-20%).  Just look at Chomsky's comments about how the consumers are so stupid, they don't realize that all the things they buy they don't really need. I mean we don't need fashionable clothes (hey, let's all dress as boring as Chomsky!), DVD players, or any new gadgets that make life easier or more fun.  Who is the judge of what you REALLY need?  Chomsky, of course. He is the final arbiter of what you really need or what you don't. You're too stupid to know what you want, according to him. He says that you should do "more important things", like...perhaps studying lingistics (which he teaches but which very few care about).  The movie DOES make some correct and good observations, especially regarding polution, however, I'd say that 80% of the movie is factually and logically flawed. It's also FULL of economic fallacies. It's worth watching I guess, just to see how many errors one can make in just 1 movie.  Despite all the ranting in the movie, it fails to mention THE biggest reason of most of the problems it brings up - too much governement interference is every facet of life.  For examples, how could a Government of Brazil forbit the people of collecting rain water! How could the U.S. government do so many things for private companies with public funds?  Just forbid the governments from playing favorites with companies, forbid government corporate welfare of ANY kind, forbid subsidies to companies, cut the suffocating red tape and regulation (esp. in developing countries but in the West too), cut corporate taxes to 5 or 10% (and see unemployment rate go to almost nothing, give people all around the world a better life, increase competition, etc.)  If these and other governments (and not corporations') problems were eliminated, the vast majority of ALL the problems which the movie brings up will simply go away.  An interesing film for anyone to see how the truth can be twisted by mindless people with an agenda to go back to 15th century rural lifestile (spoken about with much admiration), people with NO understanding about economics, how the world really works and how to REALLY raise the billions out of poverty who this movie does the biggest disservice for.
dvd||2.0||The original CSI series is FANTASTIC because you figure out the crimes by finding the evidence.  This series uses the CSI name without the investigating that makes the original so good.  It is mainly a mellow-drama surrounding the lives of the characters.  Some people will like the drama the writers have put togethor, but there's no mystery
dvd||5.0||this is like the classic that killed other classics. for some reason this is around the time when characters started dying off more in anime. so anime was never the same around this time. based off the manga loosely. i mean some parts are changed or edited. over here the manga was rare so try it if you like this type of animation. still one of my favorites in terms of anime classics. beware this is a type of movie that will kick you in your face and start to laugh. a very hyper violent film. lot's of action!
dvd||5.0||This is one of my favorite movies of all time. I saw it when it first came out and ten years later it's still just as funny. Basic plot: Ted is a bellhop at an expensive hotel and he's ALONE on New Year's night. Anyone who's had a bad night/day on the job can relate to Ted as he encounters the most 'unusual' situations. From the witches who need his 'secret' ingredient to make their potion, to a gangster's bratty kids, a gun toting psyco who likes to play kinky sex games with his wife and finally all the stories tie into a hilarious ending with a room of drunken Hollywood people who want to make Ted part of their hazardous (and very gross) bet. I don't want to give too much away but I will say that I will always love this movie and it has one of the best endings ever. If you love a good, dark comedy this is the movie for you
dvd||5.0||I have read just about every book and watched just about every movie that there is regarding Robert Kennedy, and I've got to say that this is, by far, one of the best pieces of work I've yet to see.  The movie was brilliantly put together in a way which captures the audience's attention, allows for us to actually *feel* what Robert Kennedy is feeling, to sense the tension during chaotic times, and most importantly, to understand the wonderful man who made a huge difference for America.This movie is extremely well-balanced, provides excellent insight to the inner mind/heart of Robert Kennedy, and includes many very personal excerpts either via interview or editing of films from Kennedy's life.  If you are looking to pick one movie on Robert Kennedy - this is it.  This is THE one you want to watch.  After watching this, you will see Robert Kennedy in a way you never have before.
dvd||5.0||Maybe you've heard that "it's all been done before." Gaiman and McKean prove that wrong with this unique movie. It really is something new.McKean has worked for years in the comic industry, defining a visual style that works at a visceral level. The style has many ways to look, depending on the combination of collaged photos and painterly fantasy. Some times McKean's work evokes sculpture in concrete or stone, other times it's a pen-scrawl of some horrible fear trying to waken. Disparate elements come together on his canvas to create a rich visual experience. I never imagined that such painterly fantasy worlds could come to life - well, I was wrong. This movie's imagery defies easy description. I can only invite you to see it for yourself, and to experience a movie that is truly like no other. The small-screen video makes me regret missingn the big-screen theater experience.The sound track generally works well, too, from the surreal drone of Mrs. Bagwell's Victrola to the nightmare chant of the Jill-in-the-boxes during Helena's transformation. I'm not normally one to notice, but Mirrormask's music complements its look flawlessly.You didn't come here for the story: light and dark in conflict, lost mystic artifact, plucky youth, untrustworthy side-kick. The acting doesn't distinguish itself either, despite some great hissing from the evil queen and good moments from the sphinxes. Stephanie Leonidas does a good job in the Helena role, with a convincing sulky/sultry mix. If you liked the acting in the original Dr. Who series, this will rise to your highest expectations.The story isn't the strength here. You'll see it and remember it for creating a look that others are sure to copy.//wiredweir

dvd||5.0||9 to 5 was the first film to address the glass ceiling.  It takes a look at the workplace from a woman's view.We first meet Violet (Lily Tomlin) who has been working for Consolidated Companies for 12 years and has been overlooked for most of them.  She trained her current boss and has the bruises to prove it.  Judy (Jane Fonda) is the new girl in the office.  She is a divorcee (he left her for his secretary) and has never worked for a living.  Rounding out the heroines is Doralee (Dolly Parton in the film debut). She is the personal secretary of Franklin Hart (Dabney Coleman) and everyone thinks she is "banging the boss".But the fun starts when Violet is passed over for a promotion to a man she helped train.  She then blurts out that Hart has been spreading rumors that he's been having an affair with Doralee.  And an employee is fired for a small infraction. This sends the three women to the local bar to drown their sorrows and they bond.Each comes up with their fantasy way of killing the boss.  Judy is a big game hunter with Hart as the prey.  Doralee plays role reversal and Hart ends up on a rotisserie spit.  But Violet wants it to be like a fairy tale where she is Snow White and the wicked witch and poisons Hart.  The next day, Violet accidentally poisons Hart's coffee.  When falls out of his chair and is knock unconscious, Violet thinks she killed him.  This leads to an all out comedy chase with Violet steals the wrong corpse.The next day to the ladies surprise, Hart shows up.  The ladies regroup in the restroom but Roz overhears them and reports it to Hart.  Hart confronts the ladies but they wind up kidnapping him to find some incriminating evidence.  The find something but it is going to take some time to get the evidence.  Over the next six weeks the ladies run the office in Hart's absence.  Hart escapes but the ladies changes have brought notice and Hart is not above taking someone else's glory.The subject matter here is very serious.  So to do it as a comedy is very daring and it works perfectly.  This is a film that many people identify with.  Everyone has had a boss or a teacher that oppressed them.  And this film is what we all would like to do to these oppressors.   You will laugh until it hurts.DVD EXTRAS:Commentary by producer Bruce Gilbert and stars Lily, Jane and Dolly9 to 5 @ 25 - a 25 minute featurette with interviews with Gilbert, writer director Colin Higgins and stars Lily.

dvd||1.0|| I usually trust Amazon reviewers on movie reviews, but this time ....NO WAY!   This silly, totally predictable film left us playing with the cat for our evening entertainment, hoping the movie would liven up.  Sadly, it didn't. To those who rave about the film...you must be in another dimension or something.  Thumbs DOWN.

dvd||4.0||Royal Wedding has been a favorite in the Fred Astaire canon ever since it was released 54 years ago.  Astaire and Jane Powell turn in some of their best perfromances in this film, and Astaire's dance on the ceiling ("You're All the World to Me") is classic.  The score, by Burton Lane (of Finian's Rainbow fame) and Alan Jay Lerner (future lyricist of My Fair Lady) is unbeatable.  I need not comment further on the film's merits--it speaks for itself.The film is now in the public domain and, unfortunately, nearly all VHS and DVD releases of such films are deplorable at best.  That is not so in this case.  The DVD I'm commenting on here is from Goodtimes DVD (edition 05-81171), and I must say that the transfer looks pretty darn good for a PD film.  The picture is clear, for the most part, and although there are some minor color shifts and age-related artifacts present, they do not distract.  Colors are fairly bold and are well defined.  The soundtrack is pretty clear and sounds fine.  There are no extras.  I have a very old 1980s copy of the VHS tape from MGM/UA Home Video and also a VHS dub I did off Turner Classic Movies two years ago, and honestly, this DVD looks better than both.  It is about as good as we can expect for a PD film that has not been restored from original elements.  Goodtimes is often better than most in their releases of PD films--it could be a lot worse.  Warner Home Video, which controls video/DVD release rights to the rest of the old MGM library, has not given us a studio DVD release of ROYAL WEDDING as yet, and as far as I know none is in the works.If you want ROYAL WEDDING on DVD, I absolutely recommend this Goodtimes DVD release--it is probably the best one you'll find, is at a very good price, and comes in very nice packaging.RECOMMENDED

dvd||1.0||PLEASE do NOT waste your time or money on this much-hyped piece of trash.  Not only is Harvey Walden unconvincing in his role as drill sargeant, he lacks passion as is evident by the body language and expressions of the exercisers in the video.  Unlike other excercise gurus, he does not exercise WITH you, instead he stands on the sidelines and barks out commands. The production quality is very low budget.  It looks like it was shot using a  camcorder. The set is bland and melancholy, and THERE IS NO MUSIC! All you hear is the loud marching of the feet of the exercisers, who display NO enthusiasm at all.  And, I for one, can't blame them.  I only hope they got paid for what must have been an extremely painful project for them. I was never more bored in my life.  Walden's cuing is off, and furthermore, it is difficult to follow an excercise instructor who does not do the moves with you.  That's just crazy.  What was he thinking?  I have no words to describe how awful this video is. I wish I could give it 0 stars.  Don't waste your money.  PLEASE!!!!  The other reviewers must be new to exercise because I can't understand how they couldn't see that this video lacks what an experienced exerciser would expect. If you want a high-powered, energizing, effective calorie burning workout you will not like this video at all. You will be sorely disappointed for sure.  Instead try Kathy Smith's Peak Fat Burning or any one of her step workouts
dvd||2.0||Let's face it; some of the jokes are funny. The one about Mike Tyson been like someone else's bulldog let loose in the room was really funny. I also found the bit about Bill Clinton and Osama Bin Laden also funny. However, Jamie dwells too much on the fart joke. How can you tell a fart joke for 6 minutes? After 2 min it becomes worn and so "unfunny". Why does he repeat himself so much with that line, "I am not saying she's a crackhead, just a bit crackish"? It sounds very rehearsed after the second time. If it were only for these errors I would have found the jokes altogether acceptable.What I found completely unacceptable were the racist jokes that he made against Arabs. I am black myself but found some of the jokes about Islam and Arabs to be in bad taste. Jamie could not even get an Arab accent right. C'mon, guys the accent Jamie pulled was an Indian accent and not an Arab accent.I kept asking myself, "what would black people do if a white comedian (say Robin Williams) makes the same crude jokes about black people?" Would it be acceptable?". I think not. I am sure the black press would slaughter Robin if he did. I wish to call a spade a spade. Nonsensical, crude racist jobs against any ethnic group (black, white, Asian and yes Arabs) are not funny. They degrade and demean. For not even managing to get an Arabic accent, Jamie deserves 2 stars from me.

Throughout movie history there has been a long list of bad sequels which, more or less, is what this prequel was.  Caddyshack II, Godfather III, and Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey, all horrible follow ups to great films.  So naturally I was a little worried that the film Red Dragon was going to be just another flop that followed a great film.  Any movie that follows a great film like Silence of the Lambs has a lot to live up to.  Personally, I thought that the first sequel to Silence of the Lambs,  Hannibal, didn't quite achieve that, and neither did Red Dragon.  It was a decent movie, but not quite as shocking and suspenseful as the first.  Don't get me wrong it did have its share of shock value, but since it didn't come first I had already come to expect that.  I thought that the writers would take the time and effort to make sure that this film was as good if not better than the first two films, but clearly their work shows otherwise.	 All in all, this movie disappointed me for several reasons.  As I mentioned before, the lack of violence and shock that were so prevalent in the first movie and that I, as a fan of the films, had come to expect.  But mostly, it was the fact that this movie was nothing more than a film that was made in the eighties with a different title and better actors.  I've never been a fan of remakes and this film was certainly no exception.

dvd||4.0||Before I saw this sequel, I had heard and read that it was a terrible film. However, Be Cool is still an enjoyable comedy even if it's not as good as the original. It's full of so much self-deprecating humor that you can't help but cut it a break. I laughed quite a few times, and there are a lot of fun moments.However, the film is a bit uneven. The movie tries hard to find the humor in hit men and quirky characters, but it often seems to be trying a bit too hard. John Travolta reprises his role as Chili Palmer, Hollywood gangster, who now turns his eye to the music business. Using his "negotiation skills," he tries to run an independent record label with the wife of a murdered friend, played by Uma Thurman, and try to get his young singer (Christina Milian) a hit record.An impressive cast is what saves the movie from sinking. The best performance is given by The Rock and it's nice to see him in a different type of role. Vince Vaughn also gives a funny performance though he started to get annoying before the end. Surprisingly, Uma Thurman gives an average performance and I was expecting more from her. John Travolta done an average job in his role but his performance was kind of dull. Christina Milian gives a horrible performance and she's also not that good of a singer. Cedric the Entertainer gives a good performance though he isn't in the film for very long. Andre 3000 had some funny moments and done a decent job as well. There are also a bunch of cameos including Steven Tyler and James Wood.F. Gary Gray directs and he does a poor job. He just doesn't handle the film very well and the movie is kind of a mess. There was also a ton of product placement and it got annoying after awhile. Also at 118 minutes, the film is too long and there are a lot of slow spots. The film needed to be edited badly and it clearly wasn't. Fortunately for the film, the actors are able to rise above the weak direction and script and they deliver some funny scenes. Sometimes, the film tried too hard while other times it was actually pretty funny. Compared to the original, the sequel doesn't measure up well. However, Be Cool is a fairly harmless and forgettable comedy. In the end, Be Cool is worth a rental and that's it.
dvd||2.0||What a disappointment!  I remember Siskel and Ebert raving over this romantic comedy.  Romantic, maybe, but comedy - never.  Very predictable plot from beginning to end.  And Rosie Perez was truly offensive.  A few times I couldn't understand what she was saying.  There is no way I could buy that she and Cage's character were attracted to each other.  Maybe critics liked this movie because it had no sex, violence, or rough language.  Although Cage does get shot in one hold-up scene.  It was just that you knew what was going to happen every step of the way.  I am beginning to Like Cage more and more as he ages. [ spoiler] I was really disappointed at the end to find out that the real people whom this story is based on were always happily married to their original partners.  Either they shouldn't have changed it so much or they shouldn't have let us know about the real story it was based on.[end of spoiler]  But Fonda and Cage were very engaging together
dvd||2.0||Let me just preface my review with the fact that some of my favorite movies are incredibly slow and even "boring" to my friends.  So it isn't the glacial pace of this movie that so bothered me.  It isn't the unresolved ending that bothered me.  It wasn't the violence (in short bursts.)  It wasn't the acting (the acting was pretty good actually).  But as a whole this movie was simply a tremendous failure.  I didn't care who was sending the tapes and I didn't care what would happen with the main characters.  They were unrelatable on just about any level.  This movie is the kind where you will see a remotely interesting twist in the plot about 3/4's of the way in and you'll think, "wow I wonder where the story will go next".  And then it doesn't.  That was it.  Very disappointing.  I don't mind excruciatingly slow films as long as there's SOME kinda payoff in the end.  I really don't understand all the acclaim that this movie got.  As a "suspense" movie or as an "art" film it fails pretty miserably.  The premise was a good idea that went nowhere...slowly.  Viewer beware. 
dvd||5.0||When you talk about the one motion picture that fully encapsulated all the angst and nihilism of the `70's generation you're talking about Paddy Chayefsky's brilliantly written black comedy, `The Hospital' which was released in `70.A contemporary, dysfunctional, urban hospital serves as the microcosm of America's failure to deal with not only the physical maladies of the twentieth century, but the mental and emotional illnesses as well. George C. Scott stars in the role of Dr. Herbert Bock, hospital administrator. Dr. Bock is already tittering on the edge of insanity. His wife has left him, he's estranged from his children and he's in the grips of a mid-life crisis causing him to call everything he once held dear into question. When a bizarre series of unexplained deaths begin to occur within the ranks of the hospital staff Dr. Bock is left to ponder the nature of sanity and whether he can continue to function in a world gone mad.With great performances by George C. Scott and the lovely Brit Diana Rigg, `The Hospital' is a thought-provoking film that will elicit discussion and debate. Watch it with a friend
dvd||1.0||This film is a tough one to review. The film itself is amazing. So therefore, I should give it high marks. The problem is that what most people seem to be getting from this is that all environmentalists are wackos, and there is no way we can cohabitate with nature (as if we came from outer space or something). That is a bad and dangerous message, and so I feel it is appropriate here to give this 1 star based upon that.Amazing footage, but ultimately does nothing but further the sensationalism required to seek and destroy more animals and natural habitats. How many grizzlies are hunted down and killed every year vs. how many humans are killed by grizzlies every year? Then take into account the fish we killed off because of dams, pollution, and over fishing that destroy the bears food source.How many grizzlies kill humans vs. how many cars kill humans? Shouldn't we all be more scared of cars?I agree with the other reviewers that have said that this guy is cracked and self-serving. We can co-exist with nature, but not in the way this nutjob tries to do it. Native Americans (whom we also destroyed) co-existed with them for thousands of years. They respected the grizzly. This guy no more respects the grizzly than does the cancerous civilization he condemns.Treadwell was very conflicted and troubled. Not that we aren't all troubled, not that we all don't deal with failure and disappointment, not that a good rant doesn't make you feel better from time to time, but he had a death wish, and this was really just suicide by bear the way I saw it. Am I the only one that noticed he seemed very at odds with his sexuality? Lastly, in some of the interviews, well, they were just weird and contrived, like they were acting. These weird people in this film do nothing but harm the cause
dvd||2.0||I did not much enjoy this film, and I didn't find it very clever or funny. It's true, as other amazon reviewers have noted, that Citizen Ruth stereotypes both sides of the abortion issue. Does that make it an intelligent and even-handed comic treatment of a complex topic? No, indeed.Along the way, it also stereotypes poor people, middle class people, teenagers, drug addicts, Christians, and Vietnam veterans. That doesn't make it funny, though, because the satire is so heavy-handed and predictable. Simply tackling an important social topic, like abortion, isn't going to give a film the heft to generate either drama or humor. In my opinion, the film's pretentious take on a big issue just makes it creepy. There were too many close-ups of earnest, wide-pored, and angry faces. And Burt Reynolds as the national leader of the anti-abortion crowd was just peculiar. What was he doing in this film? And what are we supposed to make of his relationship with the young Eric?Laura Dern is a talented actress, and she does a creditable job with this part -- which because it straddles genres was a challenging one. But her talent couldn't redeem this film for me
dvd||1.0||Francisco was right, this film is about as well-conceived as buttcrust.The review on the back of the dvd says "jaw dropping, " but the full quote probably reads "jaw dropping (because i was lulled to sleep like a baby)". There is about 30 seconds of truly jaw dropping footage, in the zombie attack scenes, but these scenes only account for maybe 5 minutes of the movie. The rest of this film consists of the ear-bleeding whines and yawn-inducing infighting of the human characters, ill-conceived and extremely unlikable caricatures of a pseudo-cynical and extremely redundant "evil side of human nature" message that would be better left to Jean Renoir (or even Adam Sandler considering the results here). I don't watch zombie movies for the characters, especially characters so vapid and unengaging. It seemed like the script writer read a novice's How To pamphlet and said "yeah, it needs some CONFLICT". If these characters weren't so constipated and bloated I'd give them a chance. One Amazon reviewer tries to justify all of the one-dimensional absurdity by crowning it with the weighty title of "social commentary," but that's just a mindless knee-jerk observation that fails to ascertain whether it was carried out sucessfully. It wasn't.  You'd get more insight watching a kid frying ants with a magnifying glass. The critical ambitions of this movie are ill-fitting and embarassing, and ultimately just plain disappointing since they allot almost no time to showcase the director's real talent, which is (you guessed it) the lovely undead. The rest is monotonous dreck.   I don't know why horror directors have so much insecurity about the worth of their strengths that they feel they need to shroud them in a poor man's dramatic rags. All that aside, the ending is the worst anticlimatic cop-out in the history of horror movies. A horror movie that sucks for 3/4 of its duration needs a cool climax to redeem itself, but the cut-away at the end makes you wanna kick the director in the gonads. Sorry, but anyone who calls this a classic is a friggin soundbite-repeating moron. 
dvd||1.0||Hi folks,Don't  get your pants in a bunch at the low review...its NOT for the movie..its for the appallingly bad DVD.  Grainy and soft...I can't believe they couldn't produce a finer representation of a multi award winning and in general beloved piece of work by all concerned.  This isn't even VHS quality...but then ARTISAN isn't known for  quality...its cheap enough to get anyway and throw away when  a REAL quality version  is released.
dvd||2.0||I thought the movie was alright, but I am sorry that I bought it.  I would rather have just rented it.  It seems like half of the movie is out of focus, I am sure it is on purpose but I just don't get it.  There are a few erotic scenes but they are not worth the price
dvd||5.0||I really enjoy this workout, with the DVD I can do over the workout phase without having to rewind like with the VHS.I originally wore out about 3 of her VHS workouts from rewinding and using again.  That makes it twice as much as you would just rewinding them once
dvd||1.0||AND THAT IS BORING AND SNOBISH!  I watched the first two hours of this and coudn't keep awake.  The narritor's voice was monotone. I wanted to shout at his pompous, snobish demeanor SHUT UP!!  In my opinion is not the proper way to educate is to entertain at all god's peoples. With the narritor, granted he is educated but does he have to shove his creditals and his attitude from the gecko. When you take people on a educating journey (such as nine hours long) invite them like you would invite into a warm a loving welcoming home. I felt with his demeanor and atitude felt beat up and like I was crawling on my hands and knees through out the first two hours. I am not watching the rest of the seven hours and returning this DVD set back to the library and saying "Check Please".
dvd||2.0||I'll get this out of the way: I never liked the 80's slasher films. Stuff like the Halloween series, Nightmare on Elm Street or Friday the 13th just never entertained me all that much. The idea of slow walking killers going after Olympic sprinters and still get caught felt really ridiculous to me. Of course the major draw was the death scenes: elaborate moments of viciousness. Flinging Jason into the future is of course going to elicit unintentional laughing but it's a good kind of laughing for some reason.Jason is in the future in a facility on a planet, except he escapes(of course). Disposing of scientists, including The Fly and Scanners director David Cronenberg, he ends up getting cryogenically frozen, along with another scientist. Flash forward 400 years and a ship discovers them and founds out, ooh, a nice reward for Jason. As usual he comes to life and does what he does best: kill attractive looking hotties.You don't go to these movies to expect well-written dialogue, character depth or anything, you come for the kills and to tell you the truth, they're slightly disappointing. Besides one kill, which answers the question of what happens when a frozen face hits a hard surface, the kills are kind of been there/done that. It's basically stab here, impale there, it seems kind of unimaginative. A few even happen off screen with the yelling off in the distance.Characters are just there to be taken care of brutally and some are. However, Jason does what I'm starting to hate is kill off the very cute girls. One girl, wearing a top with a belly showing gets disposed off(off screen) and I'm like "damn guy, let one cute girl live for once!". Dialogue is of course stupid but there were some funny lines. A self-deprecating parody about the sex teens have in the film is referenced. "We love premarital sex!" is so classic, as well as "it's okay, he just wanted his machete back!". Granted they won't make an AFI list but they made me laugh. It's the kind of movie that you probably weren't supposed to like: it was ridiculous and dumb but boy did it seem fun. Just wish it was better
dvd||1.0||This DVD gives documentary coverage concerning such DA VINCI CODE topics as Rosslyn Chapel, the Priory of Scion, the Knights Templar, the Gnostic Gospels, Le Dossier Secrets, Da Vinci paintings, and Opus Dei.This DVD, BEYOND THE DA VINCI CODE seems to bend over backwards, measuring every narrated word, to try to support and be sympathetic towards the Dan Brown allegations made in his novel--despite the evidence and expert interviews that they themselves provide in this documentary, they still seem to be in favor of what Dan Brown has written in the DA VINCI CODE.Out of a half dozen expert interviewees, the most notable are two "big" names who are MAJOR influences on THE DA VINCI CODE book. Margaret Starbird, author of THE WOMAN WITH THE ALABASTER JAR; and Richard Leigh, one of three authors of HOLY BLOOD, HOLY GRAIL, (which was a NY Times Bestseller in 1982), both appear throughout this program. These two are probably the biggest proponents of the Jesus/Magdalene conspiracy today, after Dan Brown himself. So it is especially meaningful when Richard Leigh and Margaret Starbird disagree with what Dan Brown has written!According to expert interviewee Richard Leigh, though THE DA VINCI CODE book says that the Knights Templar found documents to prove the Jesus/Magdalene conspiracy, in reality, NOBODY knows what, if anything, was found by the Knights Templar in Solomon's Temple. Leigh also says the whole business about the pentagram, pentacles, 5-pointed stars as mainly representing the "sacred feminine" is NONSENSE--that symbol has been used throughout history to represent other things just as often! Richard Leigh also explains that the original Priory of Scion was last referenced in 1619, but the modern day Priory of Scion people from the last 50 years are "bonkers," trying to present a hoax of the LE DOSSIER SECRETS, to try to gain political influence for themselves. This LE DOSSIER SECRETS, which appears on the bogus "FACT" page at the beginning of THE DA VINCI CODE book attempts to show a traceable genealogy of descendents of Jesus, but has been debunked for decades in France. It does NOT belong on a page titled "FACT" in the DA VINCI CODE book! That is very misleading, not factual. Brown says the LE DOSSIER SECRETS were discovered, but leaves out the fact that they are commonly known to be phoney!Margaret Starbird, another major influence on the Dan Brown novel, says that even though she believes in the Jesus/Magdalene bloodline, there is NO PROOF of the bloodline lasting into the French Merovingian line of kings, circa the first millenium A.D.The documentary, using other expert interviewees and location footage, goes on to debunk the ridiculous claim of the Rose Line alignments being found in significant locations throughout THE DA VINCI CODE novel; as well as showing there is no evidence that Leonardo Da Vinci was a member of the Priory of Scion, let alone the Grandmaster; the rose is NOT the symbol for the Priory of Scion; and Opus Dei has NO INTEREST in the "secret" bloodline of Jesus/Magdalene because they don't believe it even exists.Sadly, most of the debunking occurs towards the end of the show, in brief statements, before quickly moving on to the next topic; while most of the screen time is spent romanticizing and retelling what Dan Brown's DA VINCI CODE book claims about the Jesus/Magdalene conspiracy.Overall I was disappointed by this HISTORY CHANNEL DVD for presenting such seemingly wishful support while showing that so much just ain't so in the DA VINCI CODE book--though I am not surprised, the HISTORY CHANNEL usually sides against Christianity on issues to support atheism in their shows, in my opinion.A much better DA VINCI CODE debunking DVD is BREAKING THE DA VINCI CODE, which more clearly presents the evidence without romanticizing the novel's lies about history and Jesus

dvd||1.0||I love Asian movies. I like them because they tend to be more cerebral and less politically correct than the garbage coming out of Hollywood these days. 2047 however, was the first asian movie that I failed to finish becaase of the sheer BOREDOM of the plot. Don't get me wrong, the main actor (Clark Gable look-alike) is an excellent actor and the babes were gorgeous, but the movie itself IMO is overrated. You can argue "art" all you want but if you like an endless stream of a playboy making girls sad it may be for you(not my bag at all). I kept hoping the movie was over at several points only to realize..Oh my God it's not over! BORING
dvd||2.0||The Hidden Fortress is classic Kurosawa, in every way--except for the wild overacting, inane characterizations and lamefooted humor of the peasant pair who form a central element of the film.  Had the peasants been just as grubby but more subdued, or given comic material with more edge, skewering the upper classes as well as themselves, or been less in the focus and operated far in the background, this wouldn't have been a problem.  But instead we're offered a sort of Dumb & Dumber, Beavis & Butthead of Japan, 50 years ago.  (And yes, I know that is anachronistic, but it's all too true.)  "Stupidity is funny" wears thin after a short while, and the comic antics are both repetitive and all too easy to forecast.  Oh, here comes a rocky upwards incline: let's watch the pair pull one another down with grotesque facial expressions as they try to scramble up, etc.Which is all too bad, because while the rest of the film has its overblown heroics, its far from bad.  The interactions between cast members has both tension and grit, while the outdoor settings mark a difference from the usual run of Japanese period films (though Kurosawa addicts like myself will well recall what he could do in Roshomon).  Mifune is over the top but splendid, and the direction has energy and focus.I've seen this film twice in 25 years; most recently, just last night, again.  Unfortunately, my initial impressions were only confirmed--and I wish they weren't

dvd||2.0||This is a "goody-goody" Ronald Reagan propaganda style film. By that I mean that it tries to portray the US as the good guys being hit by the bad ones. It doesn't say what dirty role the US CIA had in birthing the whole horrible genie of fundamentalis Islam, how it set up, equipped and nurtured not only Bin Laden and his Al-Qaeda, but a whole bunch of other loathsome Islamic terror outfits now stalking the globe - like the Islamic Brotherhood and the Taliban for instance: all just to defeat the USSR, and gain access to hydrocarbon rich regions, to fuel the greedy American consumerist lifestyle which US citizens take so much for granted. I am not a "conspiracy theorist"; these people are usually an absurd breed, going off at the other extreme tangent. I live in Peshawar, the hotbed of CIA mischief in the 1980s and 90s (and even now), and the area where I live - the University Town - housed all the actors on this stage: the US officials and spies, their clubs, the Afghan "Mujahideen" leaders' houses, etc. etc... I grew up seeing all this going on literally next door, and so would like to apprise my American friends of the unpleasant truth. The National Geographic and the Reader's Digest magazines are two long established icons of US media culture that have served as the unofficial (and therefore hard to suspect) mouthpieces of some of the most outrageous US propaganda drives... Never trust their political commentaries, although their articles about polar bears and planets can be very nice..
dvd||2.0||"Metropolis",Fritz Lang's 1927 silent masterpiece,is one of the most important films ever made and also a great one! But over the years,this film has been reedited,recut,and shortened which ruins the exact vision of an extrordinary filmmaker.Since its stay on the Public Domain shelf,the prints and image quality have over the years been poor.I DO NOT recommend the following versions:1.the Goodtimes Video release has poor image quality and even worse,NO MUSICAL SCORE! 2.The now-notorious Madacy DVD, which is about 5 times as worse as the Goodtimes video release,contains horrible,blurry image quality,freeze-frame opening titles,and an annoying musical score! Just recently,TCM (Turner Classic Movies) has broadcast the brand-new,beautifully restored 2002 restoration of "Metropolis" which I taped off of and trust me,it's well worth it! Buy the Kino restored version on either VHS or DVD,but DO NOT buy the horrible Public Domain versions which can definitely rip you off! A Terrific film and thanks to Kino for making this restored version a definite must-see! I also recommend the 1984 rerelease by Giorgio Moroder (which is now unfortunately out-of-print)and buy the soundtrack to go with it

It's a fantastic meditation, though, that centers me for the entire day.  Ravi Singh has a wonderful and soothing voice that leads me through the entire video and makes everything clear.  Ana Brett does the poses very clearly, and even shows easier ways for beginners to do the more difficult poses.  I have already recommended this video to friends
dvd||1.0||Roger Ebert, a review I greatly respect and normally agree with, raved about this flick.  Roger, I love you, but you missed the boat on this one.I'm not going to review the plot because it's been done by several reviewers already.  Suffice it to say, David Lynch didn't get enough of symbolism interpretation in freshman English ("Okay, class, who wants to discuss the meaning of the impaled pig's head on page 72 in Lord of the Flies?  David, how about you?") and now want to inflict it on you, the unwitting movie watching public.  Thanks, Mr. Lynch, but I'll pass.  I didn't enjoy figuring out the obscure symbolism in page after page of Crime and Punishment and I didn't enjoy it in scene after scene of Mulholland Drive.   To add insult to injury, Lynch prides himself on putting scenes in his movie that make absolutely no sense, rationalizing it by saying life often doesn't make sense.  This habit of his is less noticible in this film than, say, Twin Peaks, mostly because the whole film is for the most part senseless.  Yeah, it's true that a lot of things are absurd in my own life, but more along the lines of "...I would've won Powerball this week except I spent my lottery money on a scented candle at the RenFaire, what the heck was I thinking..." or "...I wasted 2 1/2 hours of my life watching this dumb movie, what the heck was I thinking..." but I've yet to be visited by scrawny cowboy or a wheelchaired dwarf.  I must live a sheltered life or something.Lynch also forbids chapter cuts in his DVD, believing his movie must be watched in its entirety, or not at all (I'd advise the second.)  To be fair, in this case I don't think he's motivated entirely by a exaggerated sense of importance, but rather by the knowledge that every male, if given the chance, would overshoot most of the movie and focus on the hot chick on chick action.  C'mon all you 5 star givers, admit it!  You find the movie pretentious and silly, but the topless scenes more than make up for all the drippy pseudo-art!  To reiterate, if I wanted to see a boring and pointless dream sequence I'll rewatch Dallas - if I wanted to see a nice rack I'll take my top off and look in the mirror.  Who needs Mulholland Drive

She has no redeeming qualities.(2) We're supposed to sympathize with the South and feel nostalgia for the good old days when white folks could own black folks?(3) This movie is way too long and dull.(4) I'm glad they burned Atlanta to the ground.(5) There was nothing honorable or respectable about the Old South and the plantation way of the life. The "gentlemen" were nothing but racists who thought they were aristocrats because blacks did all their work for them.(6) I'd rather watch "Mandingo" than this racist garbage any day of the week

dvd||5.0||On December 14, 1944, as American troops under General Douglas MacArthur slowly advanced toward the island of Luzon, Japanese guards at the Puerto Princesa Prison Camp on Palawan committed a terrible act. Herding their Allied war prisoners into trenches, they soaked the men with fuel and burned them alive.Utah native Eugene Nielsen, private first class in the 59th Coast Artillery, was one of the few who escaped. Filipino guerrillas transported the survivors to the island of Morotai, where Nielsen described his experience to an Army intelligence officer. News of the massacre reached the POWs at Cabanatuan, as well, and prompted the U.S. Army to embark on one of the war's most dramatic missions -- the Bataan
dvd||2.0||There's lots of passion in Wide Sargasso Sea THE BOOK, but it's mostly emotional. It's an extremely multi-layered novel and the work of a true master. The film on the other hand is just your classic, bad 1990s film, beautiful to look at, with lots of skin, languid copulation, heaving bosoms, bodice-ripping nonsense, etc and next to no substance. It has no artistic integrity whatsoever, as its shameless makers must surely know they lifted their middle finger at the spirit of the Jean Rhys novel when choosing to make the film the way they did.I was unable to feel empathy for both the lead character. The much touted erotic scenes were not developed to what they lead to believe, and it also lacked much enthusiasm. They were incomplete and contributed little, if anything, to the plot. The viewer only gets a glimpse of the passion that supposedly exists between Edward and Antoinette. Therefore, they should have either gone all the way, tastefully (no pun intended), or have left those scenes out entirely. Now with regards to the plot of this film there were enormous holes, which perhaps could be rectified by reading the book. But for those who haven't read the book, there should be enough information in the film itself to keep the reader afloat. From the start it was unclear what was really going on with this family (despite the narration). Why did the ex-slaves keep laughing? (Something vaguely explained in the movie, though apparently fully explained in the book). Why didn't the parrot fly away? What made the mother go nuts? At no point in the movie were Mr. Rochester's "issues", as it were, fully explained. The man gets a letter exposing his wife as a Creole and dumps her like a hot potato, after (as Christophene explains) he was the one who came crawling to her in the first place. What a hypocrite. Again, maybe this is the ultimate point, that Mr. Rochester is a snob and the archetypical Victorian Englishman and that Antoinette is the victim of both his prejudice and that of the Jamaicans. But none of that exonerates the appallingly abrupt conclusion to the film. So, despite the beautiful cinematography, this movie is a hopeless muddle. I'd highly recommend the novel by the way: a book you don't forget in a hurry. Needless to say I think you should give this insulting (to the memory of Jean Rhys) film a miss, especially if you've read the novel: it'll just frustrate you, no matter how keen on a bit of easy titillation you may be feeling at the time.
dvd||2.0||not as good as the first one and pretty forgetable....it has none of the "living comic book" charm that I loved in the first one. that and there are only three stories and more animation. only the blob in the water one was worth watching. If you see it, watch for the joint that the blonde guy pulls out of nowhere after swimming to the raft in a speedo! funny. Romero and King seemed to not be as enthused as they were when making the first one.I just didnt like it...skip it and get the first one
dvd||5.0||In my opinion; there have not been enough roles that tap into the unique genius of Martin Short's humor with the exception of, "Clifford". My then teen children and I spilt our sides laughing at Short's work when we first saw this film! Several times we laughed so hard at a scene; we couldn't go on until we replayed the scene several times over. We were all in tears with uncontrolable laughter! All three of us still concider this movie to be among our most favored. Even if you are not a big fan of Martin Short; you will enjoy, "Clifford"
dvd||1.0||i can't even begin to tell how bad this movie is. it just rolls around in its own excess and asked us to play stupid and just follow along. i sold this one the day after i bought it
dvd||2.0||First off, let me say that this is a great collection of really bad sci-fi movies. The selection spans several sub-genres of the classic sci-fi age. You've got Gamera movies, Hercules movies, outer space movies. The whole gamut.Unfortunately, the sound is very bad and the movies are not closed captioned. As an individual with a hearing problem, the soundtrack was almost indecipherable due to the constant hum that permeates most of the transfers. The video is also problematic, but no where near as bad as the sound
dvd||5.0||This show was excellent in every aspect. I was captivated from the opening number and stayed glued to my TV until the closing credits. It was so fun to see the entire Osmond Clan decked out in their holiday finest having such a wholesome and lighthearted good time. I especially enjoyed seeing Debbie, Donny's wife sing a duet with Donny. And the other wives put on a musical extravaganza as well. There was even a guest appearance by the Osmond grandparents. I would recommend this DVD to anyone who wants to really enjoy an old fashioned Christmas special. There is a mixture of traditional Christmas songs, some uptempo numbers, and even some spiritual songs included. A particularly poignant segment included little brother Jimmy singing a song out in the snow. I'd never seen the two lesser-known older brothers before but they were in the middle of everything on this particular show. One of the best Christmas specials I've seen in a long time. It made me wish that I was part of their family. After watching this I'm more convinced than ever that I am the fat Osmond who Mother Osmond abandoned in the hospital only to be adopted by some nice folks here in the Pacific Northwest
dvd||4.0||This dvd shows Shania's potential as a serious musician. With Alison Krauss and Union Station as her back up here, she is simply riveting. Too bad she is more interested in making a quick buck these days marketing herself as a pop star and making purely pop albums like "Up!" instead of making enduring popular country classics like "The Woman In Me" and "Come On Over". Maybe she's living too well nowadays to make soulful music. Get this dvd if you want to hear Shania doing something good.4 Stars is for the short length of this dvd. We need at least 2 hours of this awesome music. Not the 50 minutes which is on this dvd. That's only enough time to drink 5 beers
dvd||1.0||Those who describe this story as "cute" and Joon as "quirky" aren't paying attention. For me, this movie was a trip through hell with a final destination of insanity. The writers slickly throw just enough whitewash on top to let most people ignore the darkness. Yes, Depp is great, given what he has to work with, but overall I am very sorry that I was subjected to this horribly stupid, insensitive movie
dvd||2.0||Not as much tap dancing as the other ones. You probaly have to be Irish to understand the theme because I didn't
dvd||5.0||I enjoyed the movie very much.  Since I love the idea of knights and castles during the middle ages and as Merrick says when men still had honor, I wanted to join them just for the excitement and the chance of a lifetime.  Besides I'm a sap for a great looking guy saving his damsel in distress at all costs, even if it mean't changing history.  I liked that they portayed Lady Clair as a tough, stand up to the bad guy, do what needed to be done, spy for her brother to win the battle, kinda lady
dvd||5.0||I was reluctant to watch "Almost Famous" because I figured it would be chock full of hype...but for some reason I decided to finally sit down and watch this story...and I'm glad I did.  I thought this was a very well told story about the excesses of rock and roll music, music journalism, fandom and groupies. Most movies on this topic tend to be overly cynical or over romanticized, and I appreciated that it was done from such an honest perspective.I especially appreciated the line spoken by one of the old-timer band-aides while she was looking at the new girls so scornfully..."They don't even know what it is to be a fan. You know, to truly love some silly little piece of music, or some band, so much that it hurts..."  Although I am not, and never have been a groupie by any stretch of the imagination I am an avid rock/pop music aficionado, I thought that line in the movie captured the spirit and sentiment of die-hard fandom perfectly... I liked the way Cameron Crowe humanized the groupies...sure some groupies and regular fans are definitely delusional, but many of them do have goals apart from sleeping with rock stars...and they do have feelings, just like anyone else...and I thought he demonstrated that well when developing the characer of "Penny Lane."  I can remember when back in the 70s, groupies were "little celebrities" themselves...so sersonally, I don't think that people should label them as tramps or judge them too harshly...besides, who knows...maybe someone you know or may be related to may have a "sweet little secret" they've been keeping along these years? It was the 70s after all...some of those rockers got around...and some apparently ordinary girls did too...fact: some of those gals just did what many of us wished we could do...and they were for the most part honest about it...At any rate, the music used in the movie is just awesome! It sure was fun to hear "Go All The Way" by the Raspberries as well as "Tiny Dancer" by Elton John. How could you not sing along to that 70s classic?Now that I've been reading the reviews about the "bootleg" director's cut, I'm going to have to watch that one, too. 
dvd||2.0||Don't expect a comedy in the vein of TRINITY or THEY CALL ME TRINITY. If you do, you are in for a fall. Both of those were silly but redeemed themselves by being entertaining. This one has no such pretensions. It is merely boring.The story concerns a corrupt mining company out to cheat the local town's folk out of their claims. They do this through intimidation and violence. When a couple of friends get hold of a claim, they put together a plan to secure that claim and those of the rest of the town from the bad guys. To do this, they enlist the aide of a traveling circus to serve as a distraction. They yell, they fight, they wrestle, they shoot and then they do it some more. Its not very exciting cinema.This production is made worse by the DVD. I suspect that the original film was a rather low budget affair. The DVD, however, is of such low quality that who could really tell? The edges are clipped off, the transfer is grainy and the effect is of someone holding a hidden handycam in a theater trying to bootleg it. IT was not worth the effort.Spaghetti westerns can be fun. This one, however, needs the Pepto Bismol right from the beginning to drive off the heartburn.
dvd||5.0||I first viewed this film with a friend, in my home.  He and I are both lovers of beautiful music and art.  This film satisfies both categories.  The score is absolutely magnificent and the views of Venice, beautiful.  The acting (by main character Dirk Bogard)is subtle but effective.  We found this film to be a totally soul-satisfying experience.      
dvd||5.0||My 2 year old loves watching the DVD as well as listening to the CD in the car.  I have to admit that I have memorized all of the songs on the CD and the dances on the DVD too...they are very catchy and I find myself singing them to myself when my daughter is not even around!  The lyrics are really cute and the beats are great.  Simple music but very creative.  I signed up for updates on Laurie Berkner's website so I can find out when/if she ever comes to town so my daughter (and I, of course) can go see her.  She is a great alternative to Barney and all of the other commercial characters, who I don't care much for.  I have bought this DVD/CD combo for all of my friends who have kids
dvd||5.0||My favorite DVDs are concerts, festivals, unplugged etc. I was going to buy the CD and Amazon pointed me to their DVD. I prefer DVD surround sound to CD stereo. Plus you get something to look at. I heard the Demon Days songs on the radio, and liked them alot. This is an excellent DVD. You may want to check out Bonnaroo, Cross Roads, String Cheese, even the Doobie Bros. Oh yeah and Eric Burdon and the New Animals
dvd||1.0||This is a potentially very good film. Interesting idea (bearing some resemblance to "Angel heart"). Sadly marred by a quite appauling transfer. I don't think I've ever bought (DVD or video) or seen (TV or cinema) quite such an awful copy of a movie. It is clearly stuck together from more than one original, with the logo "Delta" appearing now and again in the bottom right hand corner, but don't be misled into thinking this is the most complete version. The term "special edition" seems to refer only to the fact that it has been released !!!!! Tony Curtis does an incredibly poor intro and epilogue (clearly from some late night cheap TV series).Don't buy it.Maybe there's a better version (I read talk of a "Critereon" disc), maybe not. Still, it really isn't worth (any) money

I can play all of the songs that I owned myself but everything through the subscription service has run out and can't be reinstalled. I've done a little research about the disappearing MP3 player and it appears to be a problem that is affecting a lot of the H10's and 1 other model I can't remember right now and iRiver can't figure it out; although I've been told they are trying desperately to find the bug....So buy with caution.... 
electronics||1.0||Just got this camera in the mail as a birthday present. Installing the software was easy, but unfortunately the camera is essentially broken. It is only (somewhat) in-focus for items about 1 inch away. Adjusting the focus ring doesn't help, so this camera's build seems to be defective. My brother bought the same camera and it doesn't seem to have the same problem. Anyway, returning mine.
electronics||5.0||I've bought several of these cables and have been very happy with my purchase.  I've used them for hooking up my Gaming Systems, TV, Cable Box, and Receiver/DVD Player.  (Note: I had to buy a small 3 in 1 Fiber Optic Switch Box to handle all these cables -my Receiver and TV only had one digital audio connection each.)I believe that these cables are the best name brand VALUES currently around for Fiber Optic Audio.What do you REALLY get for a "high end" fiber optic cable that is triple the cost of this cable? I don't know.  I purchased one (which was "top of the line") and obscenely expensive, and of course it sounds great, but these cables sound great too.  Plus, these cables ARE Monster cables, AND they are THX certified!What does THX certification mean? Below is a blurb taken directly from the THX website describing it:---"THX is on the forefront of entertainment technology, offering products and services of unparalleled quality for post-production, distribution and playback of audio and visual content. THX Certification is considered a mark of excellence in the presentation technology industry, offering consumers a promise that the cinemas they visit and the products they purchase have been evaluated and tested to meet the highest standards for picture and sound performance."---A digital signal is a digital signal.  This is fiber optic cable -it uses light to transmit the digital data -it doesn't degrade like analog based on the quality of the cable.  So these cables are NOT likely to give you a worse audio signal than more expensive cables, they just are going be a little less durable, and probably use slightly less high quality materials.  Are they fragile? Not at all, but the top of the line cable that I purchased was so thick that I probably could have stepped on it on cement and it would have been fine. This THX cable is thinner and I could imagine it breaking more easily.  If you work somewhere (like a studio) where there is a good chance of rolling things over the cables from time to time on a hard floor then you might have a good reason for a more durable cable.  (Same goes for cables that are going to be manhandled regularly -i.e. a lot of plugging/unplugging and bending of the ends).Overall, I'm very happy with these cables and can I afford to buy a bunch for all the fiber optic audio connections I am now using (i.e. Receiver, TV, Cable Box, Xbox/Playstation/Gamecube)(P.S. for first time users, don't forget to pull off the tiny plastic coverings on each end of the fiber optic cables.  These are there to protect the cable during transit/storage and will prevent the light from passing unless removed.  Throw these tips away; you'll never need them again.

Here is how I rate this monitor on these four levels on a scale of 1 to 5:1. tv = 22. pc gaming monitor = 23. xbox = 14. dvd = 3The ghosting for normal operations is almost too much to live with.  I returned this item just so you know.  The rca inputs gave me only black and white images.  This could have been because my monitor was defective.  I am not sure.Ghosting during gaming was very bad.  Worse than that was it's lack of good brightness control.This is not for gamers
electronics||1.0||My family and I just relocated 3 states away from our extended family and wanted to get a good webcam to keep intouch with everyone and let our 2 year old see his grandmother once and a while.  When I saw the Microsoft LifeCam at Target stores and that it was compatible with Windows Live I thought it would be worth the $100 price tag to be able to keep in touch with family.I purchased the software and started the installation process on my computer.    Just so you know,my system is running a pentium 4 processor and has 8 active USB 2.0 connections, only 3 of which are being used for the keyboard, mouse, and this webcam, along with 512MB of RAM which is more than necessary for this product to function.The software took about 10 minutes to install which I thought was a little odd, then it askes for you to plug in the camera.  My XP system recognized the camera but told me that the hardware had encountered an error during installation and may not function properly.  I uninstalled the software and tried the installation again with the same result.  I then tried a different USB port just in case there was a problem.  Following a stepwise process I checked and updated all drivers for the USB hub, ports, etc. and I checked under the system manager tools to ensure that all were working properly.  I then went to the microsoft website and downloaded the updates for the software (this took another 15 minutes and the site crashed twice).By now I was getting very frustrated but hoped that the software update would allow appropriate conectivity with the camera.  I went into the software and found that it was recognizing the mic, but it said that there was no camera attached.  I again tried to find the camera through other means with no results.For the price paid and the 3+ hours I spent trying to install the hardware I can say with all assurity that this product is not worth it.  I will be returning it to Target for a full refund and will look into investing my money with another brand.As someone else said earlier in the reviews, "does microsoft ever send their products through Quality Assurance before they release them?
electronics||4.0||It's not listed in the product description but the Pico works with the iPod Mini too.  Like the other reviewers, I found it easy to setup: tune the radio, turn on iPod, connect the Pico, tune the Pico, done).  In my car, the static interference was less noticeable when the unit was placed in close proximity to the radio.  I noticed this as well with my home stereo. Maybe the next generation Pico needs a larger antennae, or my iPod needed charging.  Regarding sound quality, my other car has a built-in iPod connector.  The Pico sound quality is comparable, somewhat muted, but enjoyable.  The Pico does offer the advantage of displaying the iPod menu to select tunes.  I've read mixed reviews on other FM transmitters, but I am pleased with the Pico

electronics||5.0||Purchase/Service:For $2,200 at Amazon, this was a great purchase since it would have cost over $2,700 at a retail store (including tax and shipping).  Eagle arrived 10 days earlier than the Amazon estimate, unloaded the TV right to the TV stand, and after hooking it up and making sure the controls worked and the picture / sound worked, I signed for it.  And, Eagle asked if I wanted the packaging carted away.Very pleased with the service part so far.....My Set-up:S6187 61" HDTVSony AV and 5.1 surround (this is not a digital unit.....I wasn't sure it would work but there are three options to hook-up a home theater: 1) Basic connection; 2) Optical; 3) HDMI)Sony DVDMotorola HD-CATV box (We use Comcast)Sony VCRExperience:As far as the tv, the HD channels look sharp and clear, however the non HD channels aren't as sharp as my 36" Sony CRT TV (there are several settings on the Samsung for 16:9, 4:3 and wide format; setting to 4:3 or wide for non HD channels improves the picture quality a little).  But it doesn't effect the enjoyment since I purchased this for the HD, and it blows me away.The TV controls are simple to use, and the on screen menu's are easy to navigate.  The sound out of the TV is not adequate for surround sound, but I hooked up a 5.1 reciever and it makes HD come to life.I like the fact that you can connect components to an AV and/or the TV, so there is room for 3 additional components with my set-up.  I also hooked up my laptop (there is 2 connections for the video and audio on the back of the TV).  After changing the video settings on the Laptop (the mannual does a nice job for XP users), it was incredible!   The camcorder hooks up to the side of the TV, so there is no need to move the unit away from the wall.  It was a simple set-up, and again, the picture quality just blew me away!!!I highly recommend this TV to anyome looking for a 50" plus TV
electronics||4.0||This phone has excellent voice quality, including in conference mode. The only reasons it doesn't get 5 stars from me is that :a) it is unable to operate if there is a power outage - as opposed to perhaps just losing some of its functionality . Just make sure it isn't the only phone in your home.b) there is a bug which occasionnally renders it unable to operate. I can't figure out what causes it. It may be my cats that walk on it at night and press a weird sequence wit their paws :). The only cure I have found is to pull the power plug, which reboots it

electronics||1.0||All ports began running slow after just 6 months of use. Followed LinkSys RMA process and they sent me a hub in return by mistake. I followed yet another LinkSys RMA process and had to wait TWO MONTHS for the replacement switch covering their mistake. The replacement switch died after 1 week of use. The latest RMA unit ran excessively Hot until the smell of burning plastic left the air and then it would not power up. This is what I have learned about Linksys: #1) This should be a simple network pass-through device and it should not fail unless manufactured poorly - Linksys apparently cannot make a good one. #2) Do not even think about turning a broken unit into Linksys under their RMA process, they will simply send you a refurbished unit and it cannot be trusted. If these cheap switches fail they cannot be fixed and the original manufacture was flawed in the first place. #3) Choose a competitors product - I have had other brand switches running for years with no issues
electronics||1.0||Confusing light display (looking in the manual) told me there was a paper jam after printing three pages.  There is no jam. There is nothing stuck in the printer.  Sending it back now.  I do not have time to troubleshoot a new printer that fails to work properly after three pages.  (Maybe you won't have time either!)  I am very tech savvy and have checked the manual.  The device simply is defective.  I also noted that the top lid that folds down for packing to travel seems very flimsy.  It's hard to imagine it would not break in time, and since it's the paper feeder, you'd be out of luck.  I'd recommend something else
electronics||5.0||This is perfect for anyone who travels with a laptop. It's small and fits nicely next to the ac adapter in my laptop case.

electronics||4.0||This is the Ultimate Ears Super fi model especially designed for "bassheads," featuring a disproportionately large bass driver complemented by a more conventional driver for the middle and high frequencies. I don't think UE would ever claim that what results is a balanced sound signature. Yes, the mids and highs are present and the quality is clean and reasonably detailed, but these frequencies are definitely recessed and with some kinds of music this can result in an unnatural kind of reproduction.On the bright side, however, the bass reproduction is  marvelous. Not only is the quantity/extent of the bass frequencies as powerful as any headphones or earphones I've ever used, the quality is excellent. The bass is tight and pleasant, neither boomy nor thumpy. This overbalance toward bass frequencies renders the UE 5 EB's ideal for use when listening to music in which the bass is presented "front and center," including techno bass (aka "car audio bass"), drum n' bass, and many types of rap/hip-hop. For music in which the basslines are prominent but comprise part of a more balanced presentation overall, opinions will vary. With rock music, for example, the strong bass is certainly a plus, but I have found that sometimes the bass overpowers the middle frequencies too strongly, and some detail is lost.It should be noted that this bass-dominated sound signature renders the EB's a good choice for people who own iPods and feel that their music player is weak on bass. Without any EQ adjustment, the iPod suddenly is transformed into a player where the bass is PRESENT. In terms of build, the EB's superficially seem well-constructed and designed. I have heard complaints, however, that the thinness of the wires and earpieces render them vulnerable to breakage. Be careful out there! Thoughtfully, EB has includes a variety of ear tips with these IEM's (including foam, flanged, and plain) so that users with different sized ear canals can get a good fit. The EB's don't extend deeply into the ear canal, which is a mixed blessing. On the one hand, this means that if you get a good fit of the earpiece into the entrance to the ear canal, comfort is good and isolation decent. However, if the fit is not quite right both comfort and isolation will prove frustrating. Making the right choice of ear tip is absolutely essential when using the EB's.Oh, and some people think that the EB's look kind of strange when worn. Larger than the higher-priced Super fi 5 Pro model, the EB's stick out a bit. Your call as to whether this is a problem.Like all of the UE IEM's in this series, the EB's are packaged with a nice set of accessories, including a 1/4" adapter plug, a sound attenuator, a soft travel case, an earwax loop, and a silvery metal storage case which includes a winder that helps head off what is always a problem with IEM's, cord tangling.It's unlikely that the EB's will prove satisfactory as your "everyday" earphone unless you listen solely to bass-dominant types of music. The truth is, however, that even for bass-heavy music the overall sound signature of the Super fi 5 Pros is likely to be more satisfactory for most users (I own both). But as a second pair specifically for use with bass-y music, the EB's are well-designed and definitely fun

These monster cables definately enhance the sound of my dvd movies, especially the dialogue.  The old cables that I had made my movies sound a bit muffled.  But the monster cables intensified the clarity from the dvd player to my reciever.  For those of us who cannot afford 5 speaker digital surround sound, I would definately recommend these cables if you use regular 2 channel stereo for your movies or CDs

electronics||5.0||I initially purchased this model then returned it in favor of the Sony SRF-M37V because of its five one-button pre-sets which make it a no-brainer to use while exercising.  However, the SRF-59, perhaps because of its analog tuning, suffers less from co-channel and adjacent channel interference on FM.  It's audio is slightly brighter and more musical with a decent pair of headphones or earbuds than its digitally tuned cousin.  With this in mind, I purchased another SRF-59 yesterday and spent all last evening listening to it.  I literally could not make myself shut it off and go to bed I was having so much fun scanning the FM dial.  There was a program which aired last night on a local channel which featured bass-heavy 12" remixes of eighties new wave hits with, blessfully, very limited commercial interruption.  Over the course of a three hour listening session, I gradually cranked up the volume.  As I was too lazy to fish out decent earbuds, it became apparent that with bass-heavy audio at very loud volumes the SRF-59's tiny amplifier was insufficient to drive stock Walkman style headphones and peak audio was clipped which simply necessitated turning the volume down a tad to restore full musicality (I understand that decent quality earbuds require less power to achieve the same level of high sound output, therefore there will be no audio clipping).  Nevertheless, the sound quality from this bargain-priced Walkman through less than ordinary headphones was astounding.  The party is literally in your head, and the soundstage ranges from ear to ear, which is somewhat disconcerting when it is located above your sinuses.  I also made one pass through the AM band and there the SRF-59 was no slouch either.  I hauled in 1200 WOAI San Antonio which is approximately 1000 miles from me.  Though no true DX machine, after all how could it be, it is at the least a competent performer on the AM band as well (I suspect early in the evening AM DXing conditions were as good as they have been in a long time).  For more on this model and others visit Xin Feng's website.  I highly recommend this model for cheap thrills!

electronics||1.0||I ordered the Passport X50 from Amazon to save the $18 shipping Escort Radar was charging. I was told by someone at Escort Radar that Amazon was an authorized reseller.After having my detector on for ten minutes (right out of the box), it did three "SELF CAL"s, then said "SERVICE REQUIRED". I called Escort Radar and was told "If you let the car power up the unit when you start the car, the voltage can be all over the place and the unit gets confused. You must first start the car, and then use the thumbwheel to turn on the detector." It makes some sense, but if this is really the case, why don't they put those instructions in their manual? After trying this many times, the unit was "still confused", so I returned it for a replacement.My second detector worked for maybe thirty minutes before the same thing happened. This time Escort Radar told me "if you leave it plugged into the cigarette lighter over night, this has been found to cause problems." Well my lighter power goes off when I turn off the ignition, so this doesn't apply. Escort Radar also told me that "excessive heat" has been causing them problems. Now we have had a few days of 100ï¿½ heat, and I'm sure the car gets hotter parked in the sun, but the design engineers should have accounted for these conditions plus some margin when you design something that is supposed to work in a car. It gets a lot hotter in other parts of the country. There are no warnings in the manual about not using it above 90ï¿½ or leaving it off in a hot car. You wouldn't design a ski that doesn't work below 35ï¿½, would you???The most troubling part of my conversation with Escort Radar service department was they told me Amazon is not an authorized reseller, and they have no idea where they are getting the units from. Furthermore, they will not honor any warranty nor will they ever repair the unit, not even for money.
electronics||2.0||A short review...Don't buy this product. The wire is too long and the remote control is too heavy for the jack to hold. After a month of the remote and wire hanging and swinging about, the wire where it's connected at the jack gave out making this remote unuseable; I have to jiggle and find the sweet spot now just to make the remote work.Long wires plus a remote adds considerable stress and weight on the jack...a serious design flaw. If you want to buy this, I suggest you tie the wire and the remote using a rubber band around your IPOD to support it's weight without pulling the wire off the connector
electronics||4.0||I bought this battery pack for a 10 day trip to Italy and I am very happy with it. I never had to change my batteries once and I listened to it all the time. Reading other people's reviews I threw out the batteries it came with and used different ones and it worked great. The only complaint I have is the suction cups aren't that great. Several times my Ipod came off the suction cups and being on a plane with minimal room and people sitting next to me trying to get my ipod off the floor is not fun. Overall, I recommend this product. It is a little bulky, but if you're someone like me who cannot live without music, it's a great product to have if you aren't going to be able to charge your Ipod
electronics||4.0||I have not used this device all that much but it seems to work well.It lives up to its claims. The "face tracking" feature is not always fast and accurate, but generaly works (in good light).This camera does require a significant amount of light to give good results, but then again what camera doesn't.Image quality is about as good as you will get from this type of device
electronics||4.0||For the background, I've owned & used various IEM (In-Ear-Monitor) headphones over the years: Ety ER4p, Altec Lansing iM716, Shure E2c, Sony EX71, Koss KSC75.  Here's my quick impression after using these headphones for a week:Pros:1. Very good bass & well balance (not as bloated as the Sony EX71, the ER4p has tight but the least bass-feel/effect.)  Mid-range is good. Treble is just a little bit harsh right out of the box (but can be tamed with EQ.)2. Easy to drive (with the iM716 phones, I'd need to crank up the vol.)3. Very light weight4. Comfortable tips (3 sizes included)5. Decent isolation from outside noise (the ER4p &iM716 have better isolation)6. Moderately priced ($50)Cons:1. Cables are thin so handle with care.2. Some people may not like the "phonendoscope effect" (cables frictions.)  This is very common with IEM headphones, some are more than others.3. No pouch or casePS: For bass-heads, you will like these IEMs - from an owner of Beyer DT770-80's experience :
electronics||5.0||I think this is as good as the expensive over $60 HDMI cables.  I wouldn't spend money on the expensive ones.  First of all, I'm not a cable junkie nor an expert.  However, according to my research, there's no difference in performance b/w the expensive version nor the $12, $15, $20 version when it comes to HDMI since it's all digital.. hole buch of zeros and ones.  The durability of the cables... I don't know.  But unless you're someone who constantly plugs and unplugs the cables for some reason, it wouldn't matter.  Normally, you'd connect the cable and keep it that way for a long period of time, so the durability is not really relevant.  Bottomline: This is as good as the expensive ones.  I first tried out the expensive Monster brand which was $85.  Then I returned it after purchasing this, for the quality was the same.  Don't buy the expensive ones
electronics||5.0||I really likethe design on this Protector, and bought 3.It allows you to plug multiple transformers in, and still have room for regular plugs. Slipping plus in is a firm push, but not that tough. I also like the fact that it gives you a warning light if you get up around 12 amps.. Cool, but you have to keep in mind a 15 amp circuit shoulldn't have 12 amps to one plug..The cord restraint system slides out to hold all the cords, then wedges backin to hold them in place. A bit hard to set up, and a zip tie could achieve the same thing, altough this is way easier if you change things
electronics||4.0||I use this with an iMac. It does not come with drivers for Mac OS X, nor does D-Link offer any help. They refuse to admit it will work with Macs. I was pointed toward a driver made available at [...]. I remember having trouble getting it to work, but once it was working it has worked well and consistently. The iMac connects to an AEBS a couple rooms away through the D-Link
electronics||4.0||The idea is excellent, the execution is flawed.  What is not made clear at the time of purchase is that you will need a bridge or gaming adapter as well as a high speed internet connection at home.  The adapter should be built into the box. Another disappointing factor is that the quality of the video is almost unwatchable if the connection is not robust.  There should be a cache memory built in so that a clear, unchoppy video and sound come through.
electronics||1.0||I ordered this unit with high expectations, lots of memory, expandable, multiple modes, from a well known company and an excellent price; how could I go wrong?.  Easily enough, as it turns out.  I was unable to load it and control the play lists.  Trying to use it in MTP mode always crashed the host (BSOD) so I reverted to MSD (Mass Storage Device) mode using drag and drop.Dragging a folder to the device was pointless.  Most of the time the files didn't even show up, and when they did they were scattered all over the place.  I copied 82 files from the Lord of the Rings set into a single folder, only 52 could be found even during play back, but they could be seen from "My Computer" on the host system.  After fooling around with it for a couple of hours I gave up and called SanDisk technical support certain they would be able to help me sort it out. I have to admit that I was pleased with their support even though in the end they were unable to resolve any of the problems other than by suggesting that the only way to use drag and drop was to dump everything into the MUSIC folder where it would play in whatever order the device wanted; a totally useless method. This was totally unsatisfactory since there was no control over the play list and no way to even find all of the files that would fit into 8+gb.  Imagine listening to the first movement of Swan Lake followed immediately by something from 9 Inch Nails, then maybe a Bach Cantata!. Using Media Player to sync did no better.  Creating a playlist (m3u) of 82 files and then syncing did exactly the same as drag and drop.  A hopeless mess, no play order, missing files and so on.  After spending 3 hours with SanDisk tech support we were both more than ready to quit.  The tech had no more idea that I did about how to solve the problems that plagued the player and we both gave it up as a bad job.This is little machine has plenty going for it in the specification, but it's hopelessly flawed in the implementation, and this is without complaining about the stiff control wheel or the overly small buttons.  Throughly frustrated, it was in the mail being returned less than 8 hours after I received it.  I just cannot recommend this player, it needs a through overhaul of the interface and firmware; and fixing the control wheel and buttons would be a plus as well.  As it stands, it's without merit as a player.

electronics||1.0||After serveral months of use, "Card Error" was shown on my Canon Digital Rebel for my 512MB Viking card, which was half full with pictures. Fortunately, I just lost a few of pictures.  I tried to format the file; "Card Error" kept occuring on my Rebel.  This 512MB Viking card is now used for my data files.  Probably, 512MB Viking cards are not designed for high Mega Pixel camera and taking many shots in a short period of time (i.e. 3 shots/sec.).  My Canon A40 has no problems when used with the 512MB Viking card so far.  Probably, I am going to buy a 512MB card from Sandisk or Simple Tech

electronics||1.0||This bracket will not fit the eTrex Vista CX. This is because the battery cover supplied with the bracket (replaces the original battery cover to provide attachement lugs) will not clear the microSD card socket. This is very frustrating because the Garmin website even shows this bracket, part number 010-10361-00, in the eTrex Vista CX accessories list. So if you have a CX, don't purchase this item

electronics||1.0||I spent $400 16 months ago on two very similar portable Audiovox DVD players for my kids, for long roadtrips.  They were handled with care, never abused or exposed to severe temperatures.  I think we got about 6 trips out of them, then the screens went blank while in use and both units died within 24 hours of each other.  Circuit City informed me the product is no longer on their shelves and referred me to Audiovox, who will do nothing since the product is now out of warranty.  Extended warranties are useless on this kind of product -- who can wait 6-8 weeks for repairs?  Parents, find another brand
electronics||2.0||The first unit couldn't even find FM stereo stations. It had similar FM specs as the Sony ST_JX410 AM/FM Tuner it was replacing.  It was returned as a faulty unit. The replacement STRDE 197 was able to find stereo FM stations which played fine in monoral but were noisy in stereo. My 25 year old JX410 tuner did an excellent job on FM stereo stations. The second unit was returned for a refund. Sony's quality isn't what it use to be. I bought an Onkyo TX-SR304. The FM works fine with more features & expandability.  
electronics||4.0||I have never been a fan of the Ipod. I have been an Iriver H120, H320, and H340 owner. I had a Toshiba Gigabeat and currently own an Archos AV500. The reason for owning a Nano is because of the size of the AV500. It is too big to pack around unless I am on the bike or have a backpack or coat on. The Nano solves this problem and other than not having a remote, (soon), I am very happy with it. It loads from Itunes very easily and I have had no problems with it not playing certain files, (and I would reencode them if there was a problem.) Apple, don't let me down
electronics||1.0||After having an experience with slow startup speeds (and actually freezing a computer) with the 1GB Cruzer Micro with U3, I feel compelled to write this negative review. The mere existence of a software layer to access the flash drive defeats the main purpose of existence of flash drives: a fast and higlhly compatible interface. Any hidrance to this convenience makes the device a liability. I work at an educational institution wher I am responsibel for organizing presentation sessions in which speakers often bring their presentations in a flash drive. As a matter of policy, we will not allow speakers to plug in to our computers devices that run any kind of software in the background
electronics||4.0||This is my first GPS and I wanted a unit that could be used in a variety of environments such as biking, hiking, kayaking, and in the car to. I found this unit to be easy to use with a large display and convenient controls. Also the 2 times I called Garmin with questions I was able to talk to someone who is in the USA as opposed to a person in a foreign country which can be frustrating to some. On the down side to get the most out of this unit you still need to buy additional mapping software
electronics||4.0||I've owned many Sony electronics in the past and have always liked their styling and functionality -- lots of hardy Walkmen, useful shortwave and portable radios, stylish TVs and high quality cassette recorders.  I still have a Sony mini component stereo model FH-E656 (made in Japan) which I bought in 1992 for US$400+; but rather than pay to fix its worn-out CD player, I decided to purchase this new Sony MHCEC70 component stereo (made in China).PLUSES: decent soundgood functionalityeasy set-up and intuitive operationsimple remote -- but only covers basic functionsCONS:very short speaker leadsunattractive styling (for my tastes) -- resembles a boomboxonly holds 3 CDs vs 5 for comparable Panasonic unitsAt first glance, I was disappointed by the cheap construction, skimpy manual and very short speaker leads -- the manufacturer seemed to be counting pennies.  But then I thought: in 2006 for $150, I can't expect the same quality as I received in 1992 for $400.  Everything is made more cheaply now and almost all in China.  So, for the money, it suits my purposes as a nice sounding stereo unit for the bedroom.  The real test will be how long the CD changer works -- to be safe, this time I bought the 2 year replacement warranty.  I haven't blasted it at full volume, but it seems to have plenty of power when needed.I originally bought a $300 Panasonic unit (SC-PM71SD MP3 SD Micro System) which was returned because it didn't have the full data recording feature as advertised (data recording was crippled by DRM limitations).  This Sony stereo costs half as much, and has almost all the same functionality
electronics||2.0||I have several pairs of portable speakers for my laptop but forgot to bring them on a recent trip and bought these based on the glowing reviews posted here. However, when I received the speakers I found that they are much larger in size and much lower in both quality of build and quality of sound than for example the Creative speakers. They have a huge and unstable footprint when opened (about 9 inches long and one inch deep) and are not particularly compact when folded either. The sound is not rich and they eat batteries amazingly fast, then begin to buzz. I do not recommend these speakers
electronics||1.0||I purchased this product and ran home to try it out.  not 5 minutes after plugging it in to my computer, my computer freezes.  I restart and it says my device is malfunctioning.  I manage to get it working for about 5 minutes before it craps out on me again.  I try upgrading the drivers and it refuses to connect to my network. I'm a network engineer and I am well versed in what I am doing, but this card has given me nothing but trouble. I had to disable the software that came with it and use the windows wireless software to connect.  This only keeps me alive for about 30 minutes before freezing.  I talked to netgear support and they tell me that my processor isn't supported, which is total BS and just an attempt to get out of supporting me, they wouldn't even let me return the product.  My advice: go with linksys or d-link or SMC, ANYONE but netgear

electronics||2.0||It looked flashy and well-conceived on the web shopping sites that featured it; however, after setting up Panasonic's KX-TG5576M, I'm underwhelmed...    First of all, even in this day and age, it's not Mac-compatible (though the Pansonic Call Center Representative had assured me, after checking with her Superior, that it indeed was.)   So,  I cannot comment on downloading ringtones, wallpapers, etc.   (Meanwhile, these mobile phone-like features were the main reason I wanted this particular cordless phone).Secondly, the built in digital message recorder is of the lowest quality.   I was looking for an alternative to the monthly charge for voice mail through the phone company.    This isn't it. If you prefer to record your own message in lieu of the generic built-in message options, your Callers will here something sounding like a worn-out Edison recording.   It struck me as odd that with the included audio cable, you can connect the handset to an audio device with a headphone jack, to record custom ring tones, with good quality results.  Yet, to record a message for the digital answering machine, you need to speak into the dinky little microphone hole on the base unit, with the aforementioned low sound quality.  Finally, the battery life of the handset is rather short.  This is despite the (too) low backlighting on the handset keypad.  Oh, why no backlighting on the base unit? 
electronics||1.0||The extendable arm breaks very easily.  I had two of them and they both broke within the first month.  The company does have a 3 month warranty but you have to pay for shipping to send it back to them and I have been waiting over a month for my replacement.  Very poor product.  Do not buy
electronics||1.0||The battery life for this phone after one short year is abysmal.  After charging it all night, it dies after a few hours of nonuse.The redial button simply has never worked. It is not user friendly at all although I could live with this if the two issues above were resolved.   I contacted AT&T and requested that they send me a new model that works since this phone is obviously defective.  If they refuse then I won't ever buy an AT&T product again and neither will anyone I come into contact with.  It's that simple. Update...AT&T refused to do anything about the phone despite the obvious flaws,.  As a result, I will never buy another AT&T product again.AT&T, you are exhibiting the traits of a company that will go out of business.

electronics||1.0||I am totally stunned that this could be sold as iPOD compatible.  Nothing, absolutely nothing, works as you would intuitively think it would.  Pause does not pause, forward arrow does not forward to the next track (just starts the same track over and over again), and heaven help you if you actually want to find a specific song or artist.  There is no way to actually speed through a menu - you have to advance one artist at a time.  This is fine if you love Aaron Neville but chances are you will be in a limb severing accident if you are trying to get to ZZ Top.  I am taking this back tomorrow and demanding something that will allow me to control my iPod again from my iPod
electronics||5.0||The reviews sounded too good to be true.  The reviews are right on.  This system is perfect for home theater.  I have the latest Panasonic plasma.  This receiver is the perfect compliment.  Here is why...I could only start with at 2.1 set up - L/C/R and no sub woofer.  Great digital sound effects with a one button switch to stereo for easy comparison.Tons of input/output connectors.  Unless you need HDMI, the available connectors are perfect.  The speaker connectors are screw down/banana plug type for easy, secure connection.  Lots of component video, S-VHS and RCA video inputs.  Lots of analog audio connections AND two digital coax and one optical.  I use the digital coax for my DVD/CD and for my cable box.  Really easy set up.  I could assign inputs to the various selections through the front of the receiver.  The manual is written in easy to understand language with lots of pictures.Did I mention the sound.  Frys offers Polk Audio R15 for an indecently low price.  With this receiver the sound is rich - great bass and treble without any tweaking of levels.  Adding a Cerwin Vega center channel brought out the digital sound effects and this has them all.Best of all, my fashion master wife pulled the receiver out of the box before I got home and pronounced it beautiful.  It was the only low profile receiver I could find that fit in the armoire we use as an enterntainment station.The end result - I sat down and just watched Hellboy for the first time all over again in the middle of the installation.  All for less than the cost of me and the Missus going to the movies for a few weekends.  Get this receiver
electronics||4.0||The navigation kit works well although you do need a mostly flat area to set it on. Our Toyota Highlander lacks enough room between the windsheild and the dash to set it up on top, but we placed it below the gear shift on the center console and it worked quite well. The Ique was able to hold signels with no problem. I think the suction base might be a better solution for cars with out a low flat dash area

electronics||5.0||Sound quality is very good, and I haven't run out of battery so far. The base is somewhat smaller than what I expected from the pictures. The handsets are well designed; on my previous phone it happened that the "mute" function became engaged when I kept the phone between my head and my shoulders - this did not happen with these so far. Speakerphone on the base is a nice feature and makes the phone usable even during power outages. Answering machine works well. Easy to copy phonebook entries between phones.
electronics||2.0||After waiting almost 6 months for this Skypephone, and its competitor from Belkin, to come to market through numerous postponements, I just gave up and bought an Asus P525 smartphone. For just over double the price of the Netgear I got a Windows CE PDA with GSM capability and full Skype compatibility. When browsing through your phone contacts your are given the choice to call through GSM or Skype. Because you have built-in Wi-Fi, you can make Skype calls and chats from any covered area, plus you can go on the internet using IE and check your e-mails with Outlook. I have also read that the Skype software that runs on dedicated phones like the Netgear and the Belkin is very crude due to the lack of processing power, whereas with a Windows CE-based device you have much faster processors that allow a Skype software closer to the one used on PCs.For those of you alergic to Windows, just wait for the Skype for Symbian release and buy a Nokia or SonyEricsson smartphone.Bottom line: Skype is too good an application to be wasted on poorly designed hardware
electronics||1.0||I purchased this camera for my daughter for Christmas. It was small,compact, and fairly inexpesive, perfect for a preteen. First, it took forever to charge (the instructions indicate that it takes four hours). After waiting for hours, my daughter attempted to take pictures, but the camera would not work. The manual shows several different symbols that you should see in the LCD display, but none of these symbols appeared on this camera. I am returning the camera immediately and I would not advise anyone to purchase one.

electronics||5.0||I recently bought an altec lancing headset for $20 and it was the worst headset investment I've made. Horrible support for the ears and very uncomfortable to wear and they eventually broke within a week or two. So I bought this headset and I have been quite pleased with it. The mic output is extremely crisp. While talking with clients they said that it sounds like I'm talking on the telephone with them or better. They are very comfortable and rest on the top of your head unlike many headsets like my prior pair which have a support on the back of the neck which does nothing. All in all a good headset.
electronics||4.0||My first purchase of the Q9b resulted in a return as the display wasn't mounted properly within the plastic housing. This resulted in the screen being tilted downwards about 1/4" and made the viewing unpleasant. The screen also wasn't very bright even with the brightness controlled up at 100%. Having to disassemble the unit to place it back in the box required the base stand to be taken apart but that was next to impossible without breaking it. Suffice to say, quality control missed this one.After getting a new Q9b replacement, I unfortunately had a bad pixel. After using the Q9b for a week now, I noticed some red aliasing between characters. The crispness of the display is fine but I changed display fonts to 120dpi to make it look better. The control buttons on the monitor are too small. The built-in speakers leave less than desired and useless. The Q9b does not have DVI ports. At 1280x1024 mode its fine for doing basic computing like web surfing and office applications. Viewing DVD movies at full 1280x1024 mode was difficult to watch.  At smaller sizes (400x300) was fine.All in all, the Q9b is not a bad monitor for the price for general computing work
electronics||1.0||Surprisingly poor quality for a Uniden phone.  Volume is very low -- hard to hear caller.  Don't waste your money. 
electronics||1.0||Yes, I burned them in for at least 25 hours. They sounded muddy. Smooth as caramel, but veiled. The bass was heavy and indistinct. The high frequencies were not clean, and not abundant. Having listened to Stax headphones for years and years, I know I got used to a superclean, almost clinical sound. But still I cannot believe how completely different the HD600s were. I borrowed these from a friend, who bought them new and had hardly used them. Frankly, I get more pleasure listening with my Sony MDR-W20G sports headphones that I bought for less than $10.   I am at a loss to understand the glowing reviews. I would love to hear a headphone that sounds as wonderful as people are describing. But the one I heard did not. Not even after break-in.  Never would I consider one of these phones without auditioning them. Perhaps I truly heard a rare, defective unit. But if so, both drivers were defective, because they sounded the same. 
electronics||1.0||Heaven help you if you want to use this with the FM remote -- a very common usage at heath clubs which provide TV rebroadcasts over FM.

electronics||5.0||I got this for hubby and me over the summer.   We used it for our trip to Rehoboth beach and we loved every minute of it.   WE have a tape deck in the car and used it w/ a cassette adaptor.  We had not problems whatsoever, in fact it sounds much better thru the cassette adaptor than over the fm transmitter.   I did try it thru the fm transmitter and it was a pain to switch from one station to the next, but i don't think anybody can improve upon that.  I had the same problem w/ my itrip.  We chose sirius for several reasons...i liked the classic vinyl station, my dad introduced me to that and hubby likes nascar and this is switching over in 2007.The only problem i had was i couldn't read the red lettering in the daylight w/ the sunglasses on, but i didn't give them less than 5 stars because of this.  this is the way to go, plus it has a suction mount, not a permanent mount. also, if you look on ebay, someone is selling something to adapt your mount to the bolt on your car seat!!definitely go satellite, the music is great and little/ no commercials depending on the stations.
electronics||1.0||This card is on its way back to Amazon.  I purchased it as it was one of the "recommended items" with the camera I also purchased, never mind that it doesn't work with the camera.  I'm not hugely tech savvy--I (wrongly) assumed that any items recommended with the main item (a $500 camera) would be compatible.  Check to make sure that any recommended accessories will actually achieve what you want them to. 
electronics||5.0||Let's just say I am 39 and holding and have wanted an MP3 for years. My birthday was last week and I bought myslef the pink 4GB Nano. It is easy to use, but I have to agree it takes some time on itunes to import CD's, the ipod updates fast but the CD import is slow. The sound quality is good. I like that it is small and lightweight. The screen is bright and easy to read...even with not so young eyes. I looked at other brands but am glad I went with the leader. I didn't need or want to watch movies on a tiny screen...just tunes. I'm sure 1000 songs will hold me. I looked all over at prices and Amazon wins! The free shipping is a great bonus also.The case may look delicate but it feels very sturdy to me, I have had it in my pocket and it is just fine. Would highly recommend this MP3. It is cute to boot! This not so young person thinks it is WAY COOL
electronics||1.0||Do not buy.  This may be the worst product I've ever bought.  It has never worked properly.  I've kept fresh batteries in it, but it's still no good.  Within 10 feet of the laptop, I'll click three or four times and nothing happens.  Then, I'll click and the slides go in fast forward until the end.  It's quite embarrassing to be giving a professional presentation and have this happen.Awful product.  Believe the bad reviews.  It's worse than they describe.The only positive thing I can say about the product is that it doubles nicely as a cat toy.  My cat loves the laser pointer
electronics||1.0||I do not recommend Sennheiser's MX75 headphones.First, the good features:1. As with all Sennheiser products, these earphones deliver first rate sound for its price range.2. The earphones are very comfortable and easy to fit properly using the included pads.3. Once inserted in the ear, these earphones will not fall out due to vibration, movement or sweating.However, the cord has ugly problems:1. The cord is unusually stiff and consequently tends to be tough to manage. This is especially true when the phones are first removed from the package, as the cord maintains a sort of corkscrew shape for quite some time.2. The cord running to the right earphone is substantially longer than the one connecting to the left earphone. The result is annoying slack around the face and neck.3. The cord is the ugliest possible shade of green.All in all, should Sennheiser offer a new product using the same earphones, but with conventional wiring, I'll be a buyer. Until then, I've given up on using these lime green annoyances

I have also made some observations that makes this player function more efficently.-use MTP music files because they use less file space.-adjust the file size on pictures to use less memory.-use the Speck toughskin case to protect display window (extra).-use the AC Sandisk USB charger instead of the computer USB port(extra).I do not use the raio or the video settings because of no interest, and the large amount of memory the video consummes.This player does fine using the earphones or hooked up to a audio center.I think that the 2MG card will be on my list of upgrades.The only upgrade I am made was to buy a better set of earphones. I did not like the pair supplied with the unit. My earphones have a volume control on the output cord which makes it much easier to control.I am not sorry about buying this item from Amazon.
electronics||2.0||The photo on the Target website shows a cable input/output for cable protection. The unit arrived with a phone line input/output-not much help for those expecting protection on their cable line
electronics||5.0||I am pleased with this printer. Considering the price, it is a good value. The cartridges are kind of expensive, but I guess most cartridges are these days
electronics||5.0||I find this printer to be better than HP or Epson as there are not a lot of bells and whistles, just a solid printer that performs as I anticipated
electronics||4.0||The unit itself works great.  Much faster transfers than using the usb cable directly to my camera.  However, the software includes a "monitoring" feature, which checks every second or so, to see if you've plugged in a card.  I opened up Windows Task Manager to discover that, each time it checked, it was consuming 25% of system resources (on/off each second).  No wonder my computer has been slower lately, especially if I have my image editing software open (duh).My recommendation would be to skip the San Disk software and access the card reader directly from My Computer, as mentioned in another review below
electronics||4.0||I found this on clearance at another retailer (I guess not everyone likes pink), and it's fabulous.  I thought it might be just for skinny-armed people, but not so!  I've got plenty of room, it fits great, and it doesn't move.  Still looking for a solution to keep the earbud cord out of the way, though.  Makes mowing the lawn WAY more fun
electronics||1.0||The cigarette lighter adapter (with speaker) is really bad quality, the original one worn out within 1 year, I purchased a new adapter and worn out within 6 month. Garmin need to do better
electronics||5.0||I am a audiophile and am very picky when it comes to buying my toys. I bought these by accident when i was acually trying to buy the hd650's it was too late to cancell my order and since it was half the price i decided to try them out. I first hooked them up to my denon amp and listened to some cds and they sounded awesome. i could hear things in songs i have never heard before. I then hooked them up to my cheapy portable philips cd player just to see what it would sound like. to my surprise it sounded just as good as hooking them up to my denon amp. There was plenty of bass and highs and mids came out very good. the only draw back is that it is open and it bugs people that are sitting close to you. I am glad i got these instead of the 650's cause my friend owned the 650's and if you don't have a amp hooked up to it your out of luck
electronics||2.0||Bought C01U and was glad I could send it back after a testing period: Tried it witih Ableton Live on OS X 10.4.7 and a MacBookPro. Sound Quality was okay but either the buffer was too small (which caused the sound to scratch every few seconds) or the buffer was too large which ended in a lag causing me to get distracted from my monitor-earphones. I tried for about two hours to find the right balance but it didn't work out. This Microphone might have a nice sound but I can'T recommend it for high standard voice recording.
electronics||4.0||Although I could go on and on about how Skype has changed my life forever, I will try to address the issue at hand, and that is the Polycom Communicator.  Basically I love the concept of the Polycom Communicator!  When I first started using Skype I used a USB headset that works great.  The problem is that it is a serious PITA to put the thing on when someone calls because I have to either a. Try to untangle the cord before accepting the skype connection, or b. answer the skype connection then try to untangle the cord.  If I chose option a. envariably I would miss half the calls, if I chose option b. everyone would always comment that I sounded so desheveled when I tried to answer the call.  Well, now with the new Polycom communicator all I have to do is answer the call.As far as the quality and performance of the Polycom communicator...that is the only reason I didn't give the item 4 stars.  It seems ocasionally that when you are in large conference calls that the Polycom communicator will cause feedback to other peoples lines.  It is really sporadic though, and I can't seem to reproduce it consistently.  Also, the driver for the Polycom Communicator has crashed on me a couple of times.So despite the downfalls that I mentioned above, there is no way I could give up my Polycom Communicator now.  I simply love it, I just wish those other issues never happened
electronics||2.0||Although this policy is thru Apple, it is 2x the price of similar policies available from other companies that also have very good reputations.  One is Crutchfield.com which has a 2 yr. plan for $29.99 which starts *after* the standard Apple 1 yr labor coverage (for a TOTAL OF 3 YEARS).  Apple extended warranty is a total of 2 years for $59.99, rather than a total of 3 years for $29.99 thru Crutchfield
electronics||1.0||I was excited about consolidating 3 remote controls I regularly use plus my fan and light controls.  However, the Harmony 890 has proved to be a big disappointment.  I was much better off with the 3 remotes I was using before.  It was much simpler than fooling with the Harmony remote which requires so many key presses for basic functions.  I never have been able to get the Harmony to control the fan and lights.Some reviewers have said that you just need to take time to do the programming properly.  Even if you do, in my case it's just easier to juggle my 3 remotes and press ONE button to do what it would take with SEVERAL key presses on the Harmony.My Harmony is now going to sit with the other remotes I never use and I'll just stick to the 3 that work for me
electronics||4.0||If you're looking for isolation from ambient noise, these are great. I use them as In Ear Monitors for my onstage use (rock band), and if I use the foam inserts, I can stand right in front of the horn section and not get my head knocked off. I've read some people complain that the bass response is not quite what they expected, but frankly it doesn't bother me a bit.The only thing that's awkward is removing them when they're fully inserted for a while. They're rather small, and getting hold of them can be a bit tricky. I'm using small bits of tape for "pull tabs", and it seems to work pretty well.Overall, I'm impressed with this product since it's affordable and does exactly what it's advertised to do
electronics||4.0||I have seen many reviews about problem with the volume control.  I experienced the same thing until I realized that I mistaken the up & down buttons with the + & - buttons.  The volume works just fine on my wife's old Sony receiver.  The remote is quite nice and it does everything the iPod control could do.  As stated in others' reviews, you can't read the screen from a distance, thus rendering the ability to scroll through the menu with the remote a bit pointless.  However, it would be worse if the remote couldn't scroll through menus.It is compatible with the latest video iPod.  I have the 60 gig iPod but I do notice a slight hiss coming out from the speakers.  I listen to classical music and the hiss bothers me.  I bought this for my wife and she is not as picky as I am in terms of sound quality.  Then again, I don't expect high fidelity quality from this small setup.  Since I have this little gadget for my wife, I bought the Squeezebox for myself from Slim Devices to stream music which sounds a lot better.In summary, this dock does a good job and the design is not bad.  The construction is solid and I like the light on the remote.  If you are looking for great sound quality, I haven't encountered any dock that is better than this one, so this might be your best bet.  The Apple A/V cables work fine as well but it is more expensive than the dock and I see more value in this dock
electronics||1.0||I bought this for my 5g Ipod. I drive a late model Subaru with the lighter switch inside of the ashtray console. Firstly the transmitter was completely dangerous to operate while driving. Its impossible to use in Park and Neutral in my car. The controls are bulky.  The transmission cut out in mountains, on hills, and on the highway whenever I drove over 60mph resulting in my ipod starting and stopping because it shakes and wobbles in the console.  In short, it hardly worked and I was afraid to touch it while driving, lest I'd knock my gear shift out of place. Its cheaply made and all in all a complete piece of junk.This is hands down the worst IPOD FM transmitter I have ever used.  I've previously used a basic Kensington all in one model  (stolen by wife, worked well but awkward) and ended up replacing this with a far superior Griffin Road Trip.  I reccommend spending the extra $15 on the Road Trip.
electronics||1.0||A $150 calculator that I am going to trash.  I had the same problem with the keyboard (terrible response); I struggled with it for about a year and then called HP.  My warranty was out, so Hp suggested I install an update, which I did.  Now the keys are firing off 3 or 4 digits with one press of the button.  This is ridiculous. 
electronics||5.0||Three months later, I'm still amazed at how cheap this amazing piece of hardware was. Granted, it doesn't vibrate, nor have a zillion buttons, but it definitely performs admirably. It is comfortable and the buttons respond well. The unit feels well-built, and connects to the computer easily via USB. And as a bonus, it looks pretty too. :
electronics||5.0||The Logitech MX 400 mouse in my opinion was a good buy.  It is very reliable, accurate, scrolls smooth, and is precise and responsive on every surface I have used it on.  It is also light weight and comfortable, making it the purfect mouse for the price
electronics||4.0||I've used the keyboard/mouse for a little over a month now and have generally found it to do all I would wish. Of course, any wireless keyboard will at times not be as responsive as a wired keyboard/mouse setup, but this is more than offset by the lack of wires and the ability to pull the keyboard to wherever I wish.The only drawback, and it is minor, is getting used to the fact that there are no lights on the keyboard to indicate when CAPS LOCK or NUM LOCK is on. I have to look over at the wireless receiver for this. Additionally, it would be nice if there was an option for the keyboard to be backlit. Yes, it would draw down batteries more quickly, but as an option it would be user selected.All in all, a good wireless keyboard/mouse combination, and one I am quite glad I purchased.Life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well-preserved body. But rather to skid in broadside, thoroughly used up, totally worn out, and loudly proclaiming,"WOW, Lord! What a ride!"
electronics||1.0||It's a nice look, but it tips over very easily. It is not steady on a rug surface dispite what the picture on the box shows. My advice is if you need a CD rack that holds a lot of CD's? Save your money and invest in something nicer and more sturdy
electronics||1.0||This card DOES NOT work with NOKIA 6682. I bought this card from an other website and missed the earlier review here. The product description does not show voltage details and compatibility with phones. It is very misleading as the description uses the word "mobile phone ready".Sandisk should address this isse by providing proper product description
electronics||5.0||Monster has went over the top on this THX component video cable. Instantly noticed a superior picture
electronics||2.0||Got it home and it had poor focus. The center was ok but the sides were definitely out of focus. the next morning the focus problem was gone. Go figure. The big problem for me was the time it took to  change channels. A full 3 seconds. Went back to the store and found this is a common problem with tube tvs. Well I took it back and went to Walmart and got a Sanyo HT27546 for $270. Good set with quick channel change. It also has an optical digital outputwhich the Toshiba did not. The Sanyo also has a full one year warrenty. Sound on both TVs is fine. A small point. The Toshiba can not be set up to go to closed caption when you hit Mute
electronics||5.0||i bought one version from best buy, then i bought another with different buttons, then i bought this platinum one because its so cool looking, just make sure you save the code
electronics||1.0||Amazon quickly shipped this item to me and I was ready to rock 'n' roll -- until I plugged it in.  There was a distinct buzzing noise that both myself and the caller on the other end could hear.  The buzzing noise stopped when I hit mute, so the Plantronics rep said it was a microphone problem.  Amazon was very gracious about their return policy and I was quickly sent a new phone free of charge.  Well, the second phone does the same thing and I'm returning it to get a refund.  Maybe just my phone line?  Possibly.  But I've tried two phones now and have the same problem with both
electronics||5.0||amazon attempted to  extort second payment for undeliverd items claiming they would refund late
electronics||4.0||This is a great multi-function printer/scanner/copier/fax machine for a small office or home business that has a light to moderately light document workload.Print quality is excellent, scanning quality is excellent, copying quality is excellent, faxing is faxing.The control software is fine; not great, but it does the job.  The networking features, including built-in wireless, makes this printer a snap to integrate into your office / business using a wireless network.  Some concerns:  after heavy usage the top document feeder, used for scanning, faxing, or photocopying a stack of loose documents, begins to jam.  The rollers need to be cleaned to avoid this, and getting jammed paper out of the top document feeder is very difficult.   However, the fact that this piece of equipment even has a document feeder for this sort of functionality is pretty good.  The fax log keeps a record of outgoing faxes and you can re-send them easily enough, but you can't re-print faxes received; the fax log merely logs their reception, but not the fax itself.Overall it's a good multi-function at a reasonable price with a lot of functionality built into it.  Would recommend to anyone who only has a light document load, with maybe the occasional large document scanning / copying requirement
electronics||2.0||I have had this phone for about three years. I bought it primarily to use it as a good quality speaker-phone (with mute) for long conference calls. It was quite expensive (I paid $200 to get it) but here are what I have found to be its shortcomings: No caller-id display. This just baffles me. I get caller-Id on all other phones in the house except this one. I have tried every possible varient (resetted settings, disconnected other phones, etc.) but nothing works: I always get "NO ID MESSAGE" on the LCD. The second major shortcoming is that called-parties often complain about the feedback on the speakerphone. One way to reduce that is by lowering the volume significantly, but that sort-of defeats the purpose of having a good speakerphone. Another minor shortcoming is that the phone requires to be powered even though it is a corded-phone (hence will not work in case of emergencies). Finally, two connect two lines you have to use an ugly adapter. One good thing about the phone is that it looks quite good, has a professional appearance, and claims to have a duplex-speakerphone.
electronics||4.0||camera works great!  the first one I ordered did not function correctly but Amazon promptly replaced it.  resolution is good and audio is a great bonus that works very well.  a great feature for me that I found was not available on all other devices was the ability to have video stored on a network folder.  additionally, there is no software required to run this
electronics||2.0||Phone seemed nice but I bought it to hang on a wall and it wouldn't due to manufacturing.
electronics||2.0||This is a poorly designed remote. I have six devices connected to my HD television set. The software depends on the user assigning positions to the various inputs to the TV and, in my case, routinely activated the wrong device when I used the remote. I purchased a Logistics Harmony remote and it works perfectly. At this point the only thing that I use the remote for is to remotely turn on my satellite receiver at a certain time during the day to record to Replay TV (which cannot turn the TV on and off).
electronics||1.0||I agree with the person who says there are no instructions and poor image quality. I wonder if they gave us a mini jack like games systems use if it would work better on TVs that have the 3 jacks on the front. Games systems get good image quality so why is this so bad... No info on this from Monster. Looks like a very good product but I will return it unfortunately. I did discover though that I can use a stereo jack with R-L on one end and a mini jack on the ibook end to give me audio speakers on any TV or Stereo for my iTunes, and audio for a DVD that I am playing but I don't need to spend this much money to get that. If the image were good I would keep it. I would rather show my slide shows from the computer. The image was very bad..
electronics||1.0||We've had this printer at my office for about 2 1/2 years. It's a giant waste of money. Magenta cartridges spew toner everywhere. Cyan cartridges streak. It's even worse when you use the manual feed. HP has no answers because they deny all the issues. HP's support is lackluster at best anyway. The first time when this machine was under warranty it took me three weeks worth of phone calls to get anything accomplished with them. Stay away from this printer at all costs. If you own one it makes a nice doorstop or paperweight. This is totally unacceptable considering toner and printer costs. I expect more from a product with the HP brand stamped on the box. To bad you can't give 0 stars
electronics||4.0||I use these batteries when I need power immediately and I don't have a set of rechargeables ready to go. I also use them as backups - so I don't get caught without power and have to pay $1 a battery at supermarkets and convenience stores. Unfortunately, my kids keep stealing them instead of recharging their own set
electronics||4.0||We recently purchased 4 of these phones and all of them work fine. The CID works perfectly for both lines. The interface/menu takes a few minutes to learn and get used to but I wouldn't call it "non-intuitive".The Redial button (as you can see in the picture) is right above the number pad. If you can't find it, you might want to buy a phone with less buttons and less features. And it's pretty simple to redial a number in the CID display... when you see/get to the number press Enter twice (Once to bring up the "MENU", and Once more to "DIAL"). In fact you can also save that number into the phone's memory through the menu (press Enter once and scroll through the options)
electronics||5.0||I'm very pleased with this camera.  I updated it with the new drivers and software on the Creative site (from January 2006) immediately and I have not had any of the problems others mention.  The image quality is excellent with good lighting and the camera is fast since it is a true USB 2.0 camera. It will work with USB 1, but be sure you use USB 2.0 for better quality.Video calls run a bit choppy if there is a lot of movement, but for basic conversations, it is fine.  I use 8 Mbs cable and I connect with people using the same or high speed DSL.This camera takes great video & photos and has an excellent one click panoramic option that does all of the stitching for you.  If you want to take a large group shot, it is really cool.  The other features like security and remote monitoring are very useful as well.  I don't use the face tracking.  The base deserves a mention too.  I use this on my notebook and on my desktop.  It's cool that the base works with both notebook screens and on flat surfaces.  Highly recommended for the price now with the current rebate Amazon is offering
electronics||2.0||We have had ours for almost a year - it still works great, but there is one big problem - the display is a white/violet bright light.  Great for visibility of the clock when you need it, but unfortunately, even when it's on the lowest setting, it lights up our whole room!  My husband sleeps through it fine, but I need a dark room to fall asleep and I always have to throw a sweater or towel over it.  We finally gave it up and switched back to our old clock radio
electronics||1.0||It looks sexy, but it just doesn't work. The scroll pad is so finicky I wanted to throw it out the window after the first hour. About half the time it moves the cursor when you want to scroll, or it scrolls when you want to move the cursor. The other half the time, it does nothing no matter what part of the pad you touch or how hard or lightly you press. Also beware that if you return this just because you're not satisfied with how it works, Amazon will charge you for both outgoing and return postage! (I've giving it one star out of pity, and because it does look sharp.
electronics||4.0||I decided to upgrade my laptop with the wpc54gs from the wpc54g.  I did this because the "g" card would randomly disconnect when the WEP or WPA security was activated.  Living in a home near about 6 other networks I really wanted the router and wireless network secured.  So, I purchased this card to see if it would fix my problem.  I can happily say it solved the random disconnect with WPA security turned on.  The range is just fine and all my network connections seem solid.  Have not had a disconnect yet, over the last 5 hours.The reason I took away one star is the fact on the Wireless Network Monitor V2.1 there seems to be a flaw.  When I connect to the network and internet the monitor says it is hooked to the network but unable to find the internet.  Obvious by my submission of this review, the internet can be found and used.All in all a good product that functions just fine in my A45-S121 Toshiba laptop.Phil (Mesa, AZ
electronics||1.0||This LEXAR brand has had issues with it's Memory Cards.  I lost lots of pictures from a vacation to Disney World and a Convention. Their site had SOFTWARE that was to help recover some of those lost images!!  I have never had Flash memory trouble until LEXAR!  I now only buy SCANDISK items. Samsung invented this tecnology and SD is their product. The Store I bought the LEXAR chip was in a hurry to give me another chip I could trust. He gave me the higher costing SD chip. I wasn't the first to have issues from buying it in his store. He took a $50.00 loss to make me happy. People take lots of photos now that we went Digital. Imagine looking for some pictures you know you took and they are not there!  Most think they messed up. WIth this chip you will have that happen so pay very close attention. Most of what is lost can not be recovered. Pay the extra money for SCANDISK.
electronics||5.0||This is very comfortable and works very well.  It's heavy enough that it doesn't move around or push the keyboard, as some of the other types of wrist rests that I've used have done.  Yet it's cushiony while sturdy enough to provide support. 
electronics||1.0||The mouse pad is a great idea with superb support for the wrist. Unlike some customers, I did not detect any odors or problems with the materials use in the gel pad.  However, the mouse pad did not work with my Logitech optical mouse.  Great idea but poorly implemented.
electronics||1.0||I had a D-link USB adaptor before which was really good, but was old.  I upgraded to a wireless G Linksys USB adaptor, but I was supplied with old goods (a Linksys sales manager confirmed that), so I sent that back.  I thought I'd try D-Link again.  Bad move.  First, I tried to upgrade the drivers.  My current version was 1.0.5.0.  I downloaded the version 1.12 from D-Link's site.  After uninstalling and reinstalling (several times) I still had 1.0.5.0.  An hour and a half on the phone with D-Link tech support and I still had 1.0.5.0.  Another hour on Google, and I'm not the only one with this issue.  Seems to be a version-control issue with D-Link.  Then, even more irritating, every time after I use my wired connection and go back to wireless I have to reinstall the drivers and reboot.  And re-enter all my security info again.  (I believe this has something to do with using a different USB port from the last time, but whatever the reason, it's unacceptable).  This adaptor's going back too.  Don't know what I'll try next. 
electronics||4.0||With so many of these ipod speaker docks on the market, it was sort of struggle to decide.  Ultimately, I felt very comfortable going with the Bose brand.  Plus, in my opinion, this is about the sleakest and best-looking unit out there (I went with black; I'm not an Apple-white drone).  The sound is very, very good for small to medium size spaces.  There are not a lot of features to the unit, which I think is a good thing - it just focuses on the sound and the small footprint.  Mini remote control work well and again the small size makes it unimposing in this world of too many remotes.  Power cord is plenty long and I like the fact I can easily move the thing to a different room if I need music there

electronics||5.0||I recently purchased a PNY 512 MB Secure Digital Card from Best Buy when it was on sale for $29.99 each card. I had been given a SanDisk 256 mb card for christmas the past year, which had gone curropt. The PNY is so much better and so much cheaper for virtually the same quality or better than my old SanDisk. I would recommend this product to anybody who is fed up with SanDisk or any other high priced memory manufacturer.Steve
electronics||1.0||These phones had so much static, you could not hear!!!  We ended up having to return the phones and find something that we could actually use!
electronics||2.0||The sound crackles if the cord bends a bit at the connector. All around poor quality and construction. I'm thinking about returning it..
electronics||5.0||I had a Zen Vision:M but I returned it because I decided I didn't need quite that much storage capacity and the hard drive seemed to sputter and whirr too often and I wanted the peace of mind that comes with owning a flash player compared to a hard drive player, so I decided to go with the Zen V since it's interface is almost identical to that of the Zen Vision M's(which I liked).The first thing you will notice is the physical design.  Initially I wasn't that impressed, but it's really grown on me.  The height x width dimensions are comparitively much much smaller than the iPod nano.  You can actually wrap your entire hand around the device, and the soft finish feels very nice in your hand.  The second color that fills the seams of the player is a very nice touch as well.The music is organized your standard Artist-Album-Song interface that is becoming quite a bit stale in my opinion. Still, it's as simple as you can get I suppose.  The device officially supports album art although it seems to be very hit-or-miss in that regard in my experience. The screen is vibrant and colorful but is very hard to see in bright sunlight. The middle joystick is used for navigation and it works very well in that regard, although wedging your thumb underneath to move upward can be tricky sometimes and result in an accidental button push.  A dedicated volume control switch is found on the side and a hold switch on top.  The player syncs with WMP11 via USB connection.  Syncing it is a snap although I was not impressed with the transfer speeds. Also, if you sync the tracks on your player back to another computer, album art will not be attached to the music tracks.If you are a newbie to buying MP3 players make note of the different sized models.  The 2GB model for instance advertises that it holds 1000 songs but these figures are theoretical maximums based on low quality files.  Most of my files are mid bit-rate WMAs and I can fit about 500 songs on the player, half as much as advertised.  Summary:Pros:Excellent physical designEasy to use interfaceGood navigationGreat sound qualityCons:On-the-go playlist creation is flawedAlbum art support hit-or-missSlow transfer speeds from WMP11Accesories rarely available in brick-and-mortar storesUltimately, I recommend the Zen V over the iPod nano mostly on the strength of it's vastly superior physical design.

electronics||1.0||SUCKS I had this right form the start with my compaq 7970 which is amd k7 processor and has the via chipset.  The computer seemed to work for a while or at least had few errors when I first used it but I guess that was when I had windows 98 for 2 years. When I upgraded to windows XP it just got terrible I had frequent blue screens and errors. I thought it was my video card or my ram or Irq sharing tried all that didn't seem to be it.  Eventually I was wrong it was this card as mentioned before by others apparently it does not like some amount of internet use and when the card gets stuck it shuts down and windows xp just says error or points to the video card or irq sharing ot page fault in non page area as the problem.  The card was the problem buy another card other than fa310,fa311 the one I have and fa312 even if you have intel or something else I would not waist my money on this card it will probably give you problems down the road.  I have tried updates from [...] and updating my ram and video card  have checked my irqs and reformating hard drive none worked. I put in a 3 com card I bought a few years before this computer and wow no crashes that other computer is now wirelessly connected to my home network

electronics||2.0||My husband bought me this for Christmas because we were moving to a new city. He picked it out because unlike Garmin and Magellen it was created from the ground up for use on the road. The features are easy to use, the directions are great and when you need a new route because of roadblock or traffic - it really comes up with a great plan. However - my first one lasted 3 months before it died, I then replaced it with another one and it died 3 months later as well. I was very reluctant to buy a different brand - but had to for dependability. I still don't like my Garmin as much - but at least it works. Come on Tomtom - get the electronics working as well as the maps and directions
electronics||5.0||This isn't my first mp3 player. I have a couple of the years and since my last one died I was looking for a quick, cheap replacement. I also needed a flash drive for work. Don't underestimate this, if you use the net at a library or cafe then you'll realize that 1. not all players/drives are recognized as drives and/or 2. you've got to carry an extra cord with you to plug into the usb port, which gets annoying quickly. when you clean out your purse and discover you don't have it with you. With this you get both in one. It has a built in usb port which is recognized fine in most operating systems, even win98. The sound quality is good, I can't tell the difference between this and my $100.00 player. The controls do take a few seconds to get used to, but once I did I find I preferred them. They are easy to use one-handed.An unexpected bonus is that its great for audiobooks! If you turn off the player, it starts back up exactly where you left it, be it in the middle of a song or in the middle of a chapter! Its small without being too tiny, its design is simple enough that there is nothing to fall off or get lost and technophobes won't have a heart-attack. Its doesn't hold a lot of music at only 128mb or have a shuffle feature, but if you need to carry more than an album or 2, or need extra features then you'll want more than this player anyway. The best feature is the price. I found this one at my local ToysRUs for $15.00. It also plays both mp3's and wma. It won't play AAC but if most of your music is this format you'll better off with an ipod.This would make a good first player for a kid or for someone who needs a usb drive and music without all the bells and whistles. I'm giving it 5 stars because it does exactly what I need it to do without any hassle
electronics||1.0||I installed the board and my PC (running XP Pro) won't boot. I tested all the PCI slots with other cards (and mixed them up too) and the PC boots fine. I returned the card and got a new one. Same problem. I removed all of my other PCI cards and left this one in there alone ... same problem. I'm speechless. I guess it's not compatable with some systems. By the way, I know my set-up is fine. I have 3 PCI slots filled and 3 additional USB devices and all is well. I never had a problem like this before
electronics||1.0||The sound is really great, but there is one problem with this headphones they keep falling from my ears no matter what rubber caps (they come with 3 different sizes) I used. The design flaw makes them unusable for me
electronics||1.0||I had to return two faulty DVD players. One would freeze frame the picture and the audio would keep on playing.  The replacement DVD player kept saying "Wrong Disc" and was very very loud when it would actually play a disc.  I ended up having to search and find a different DVD player all together because they wouldn't replace the 2nd faulty product.  (Which was packaged inappropriately and possibly damaged in shipment)
electronics||5.0||Seems nowadays everything uses AAA batteries so this 30 pack is perfect for just about anyone that needs them. You know who you are. The ones with the video games, remote controls, clocks, and whatever else you need. Expecially good to get during the holidays, you should never be without
electronics||5.0||We bought this product for a long car trip and the kids loved it. I've also used it and thought the sound and picture were wonderful. It was exactly what we were looking for and for a fantastic price! We are very happy
electronics||5.0||We replaced a tape unit with this one and are so pleased.  No more waiting for the tape to rewind and this one keeps the messages once played until you remove them.  Also very accurate on time.  We love it!
electronics||5.0||Just what I expected - good quality, convenient and holds lots of musi
electronics||5.0||This is definitely a comfortable mouse if you don't have big hands. It is a pretty small mouse but it contours very nicely, even if you are left-handed. The extra buttons are handy for lazy people like me who don't like using the keyboard or clicking on buttons to go forward, backward, and switch between programs. The button in the middle though (the one that lets you switch programs) is out of the way. It takes just a bit more effort to use, meaning that you would have to remove your hand from the default contour to use that button. I actually hardly ever use that button. I can't live without the forward/backward buttons though. I find myself man-handling other mice thinking they too have those neat, little buttons. The mouse has a really good response to movement as well. I've used it for gaming as well, though I admit I'm not a hardcore gamer. I really recommend this mouse. I can't imagine spending more money and getting a remarkably better mouse than this one

electronics||1.0||The transmission quality is very poor. I was unable to find a single frequency free of static. While operating the Belkin TuneCast II in my car I found that driving over or under bridges, under traffic lights, under power lines, or near large trucks increases the static to a level where the music can not be heard at all. The only way I could get audio clarity equal to that of a dirty and scratched record or a distant AM station was to hold the transmitter to the face of my radio. What a piece of poo! Can I give it zero stars? And don't even get me started on the excessive packaging that you'll need to use a diamond tipped jack-hammer to open
electronics||4.0||The sound range and clarity is quite good, they are comfortable. My only hesitation is the cord is too short for my purposes, I'd like to use it with my computer not a MP3 attached to my belt
electronics||1.0||I've had the X2 for roughly 14 months. The X2 was used for watching movies (about once every 2 weeks) and big sports event (NCAA/NFL finals.. etc). The unit worked up to about 1200 hrs, then the lamp blew. I was hoping to get to at least 1500 hrs before the lamp went out. Good picture quality for the price (799) but short lamp life (get extended warranty). Check other units first
electronics||1.0||I agree with the previous review.  This phone cord worked twice.  Now, it only retracts about half way, and keeps getting worse.  I'm returning it for a refund.  Don't waste your time with this
electronics||5.0||I have always been very pleased with the SanDisk products. I would highly recommend them
electronics||1.0||I bought an Alpine 9847 and the Ipod interface. I works but it totally hijacks your Ipod. The beautiful intuitve, fast controls on the Ipod itself are locked out and you can ONLY control the Ipod from the car stereo. It is therefore very hard to deal with especially if you have a large music catalog on you Ipod. It is very slow, not at all intuitive. Even after getting used to it it is no good. The info on artist, album or song title imports from the IPod very slowly. Turning the volume knob is equivalent to circling on the Ipod but one turn eqauls about 3 spots on the list unlike one circle on the Ipod which equals dozens of spots on the list. Therefore if you have a large catalog you have to spin the volume knob 100 times to get thru a long catalog list which takes forever........Very annoying, very slow, very cumbersome. If only it did not deactivate the normal controls on the Ipod itself. A better and much cheaper solution is to find a car stereo with some form of line in, either stereo mini plug or RCA jacks. The just connect directly and use the IPods own controls which are infinitely better. I replace an old stereo to get the Ipod option and am very sorry I did so
electronics||5.0||I bought this speaker cable because I wanted it to fall in a straight line and hug the walls without curling all over the place. This cable does just that. I'm very happy with it. If that is your goal too, I can recommend this cable.Regarding the long standing debate of whether Monster cable sounds better than cheaper cable, I'm not an audio engineer and don't have an opinion
electronics||5.0||Kingston's 2GB Data Traveler USB drive is perfect to storage files. I have looked for a 2 GB USB and found this one to be the cheapest based on its characteristices. I think it is a bargain price
electronics||2.0||I bought this for easy transfer of pictures from my digital camera with SD memory card anywhere not home and sometimes from other peoples memory card (xD and memory stick)..First of all I was disappointed with the flimsy, plastic design and the size of it. But it would have been ok if it worked!..IT DOESNT READ my SD card. And as menetioned in other people's review hard to insert and take out the cards! I'm scared if the cards get scratch and ruined whenever i do it. I wish I have bought this after reading amazon reviews...it's useless now. I'm lost how I can get sd card work on this and if I do, scared of frequent use for the flimsy design
electronics||4.0||At first, I was not sure about if this Windshield Mounting Bracket was going to stay in place while I drive trough the streets. However, I was very surprised when I found out that the Bracket stayed put all day going from one place to another, even under some vibration. The suction rubber system is quite strong. It has 2 angles for adjustment, and you can rotate the GPS clockwise/counterclockwise.Pros: Strong suction rubber system, GPS mounting systemCons: Lack of a 4th angle for adjustment (the GPS can only be adjusted in the windshield plane, so you can not turn it towards your face for easy viewing - that's why I give 4 stars
electronics||4.0||Although the rear speakers need a power plug, this system solved my problem of being unable to run a signal wire to the back speakers from the front. The sound is OK, not awesome, but not bad. Better than the TV speakers by a long shot. They can also be nicely controlled with my Harmony remote
electronics||2.0||I received the camera and was not happy when I found a cheap mic that was attached to the cord of an ear peace instead of the the superior sound mic advertised in the ad.  I called Amazon, they had no appolgies and said the most they could do was refund my money.On another note the picture quality was ok but froze at least 2 times or better per use, as for sound I had to put the mic up to my mouth before the person on the other end could hear me.  Not very happ
electronics||1.0||Agree with the prior reviewers.  I can not get it to retract any longer and that was only after 3 uses!

electronics||5.0||This product was very easy to set-up. Hooked up 4 computers and had all up and running in no time. Been running 3 months with NO problems what so ever. Would highly recommend
electronics||2.0||I've had this mouse for about a month...use it with my Mac G4 at home...and I'm exhausted. It feels very nice in the hand and I really like the scrolling ball feature (hence the 2 stars), but it's just not predictable. Sometimes it glides along smoothly, most other times it tracks across the monitor like you're mousing over pebbles. I've tried a number of different surfaces: desktop (light woodgrain); smooth, medium gray fabric mouse pad; mouse pad made specifically for optical mice (better than the other two) and I have even tried picking the thing up and shaking it to knock it into submission--to no avail. It still lags and I have a hard time honing in on an object to select it (or to check a box or pick up a puzzle piece in a jigsaw puzzle...)I use Photoshop and other mousing intensive apps all day at work and at home and I need a mouse that is precise (for silhouetting, etc.). This just isn't it. You shouldn't have to think about mousing when you're doing it, it should just happen--immediately and smoothly, corded or cordless. And a "newer" technology should work better that a gummed up "old" tracking ball mouse!Maybe it doesn't like my older Mac. Maybe it's the bluetooth adapter. Whatever it is, it's not working...I'll be trying the Logitech MX1000 next. It has a recharging base and is Laser (instead of optical). I'm hoping the higher price will translate into better performance
electronics||5.0||The convenience of this product is terrific.  Whenever I show people how it snaps in half, they're amazed at the ingeniousness of it and they say how they want to get one.  Now that all computers have USB ports, I can put my photos into any computer anytime I want without worrying about the docking station.  A must-have product for every digital camera!!
electronics||5.0||There are lots of reviews here and most appear to be on-target relative to my experience with these headphones.  But here are my 2 cents:I got these to replace some aging Sony MDR-V2's that I purchased maybe 10 years ago.  The ear cushions of the MDR-V2's had begun to deteriorate, and I figured it was time to see what had improved in 10 years.  I just compared them to the older V2s and I can say that the V6 is definitely better.  They fully surround the ears (V2s just sat on your ear, pressing on them).  The V6s also seem to offer more detailed sound.  I concur that they sound a little bright, but I can take care of this on my iPod by setting the EQ to ReduceTreble (but I like the brightness, so sometimes I don't do that).  I do NOT concur with other review comments about weak bass.  They appear to have the right amount.  (IMHO - it is a shame that bass has been overemphasized in the past decade, at the expense of flatness and non-coloring of sound).  I also concur that the sensitivity of these is quite good (plenty loud for me with the iPod - and I listen at good levels - albeit not ear damaging ones).As a last comment, I notice Amazon has these for about $65.  I paid $99 at a local store.  Buy from Amazon !  (no - I don't work for or invest in them ;-
electronics||1.0||I bought this and I'm sorry.  It sounds horrible.  Don't waste your money because you'll just have to buy another one anyway for any true enjoyment.  This crap is barely good enough for my bathroom
electronics||2.0||I'm a longtime user of Wacom Intuos tablets and I was looking for something similar with wireless capabilities for my new dual 2.5ghz-G5. There were no wireless Intuos products available at the time of purchase, so I went with the Graphire Bluetooth. Unfortunately, the product leaves a lot to be desired and after a couple of weeks of use, I plan on returning it. The major problem lies with the pen--both in design and responsiveness. Design: the Graphire series is cheaper than the Intuos, and there's a good reason why: the Graphire pen is thinner, lighter, and has no grip. If you have very small hands this might be acceptable; in my hand this feels like a toothpick. It's very difficult to manipulate a tool effectively when it doesn't feel like it has any durability. Additionally, the Graphire pen stand is little more than a piece of transparent molded plastic and slides around the desk whenever I put the pen back into it.Responsiveness: There is a half-second delay whenever using the pen to click in any finder-related options--opening windows, selecting files, etc. 1/2 second may sound acceptable, but if you, like me, use the pen for everything, not just drawing, believe me it is utterly maddening. On the other hand, the mouse behaves perfectly with no delay at all, so I know it's the pen and not my computer.The tablet is attractive and the mouse works fine, but the bottom line is that it's more important for me to have a responsive, durable pen than a wireless tablet. If you've never used an Intuos you may not recognize the deficiencies, but for those who have, this is like going from a Mercedes to a Honda Civic. You'll get better gas mileage with the Civic but the Benz gives you the  best overall driving experience. I need the driving experience, so I'm going back to the Intuos--wire and all.
electronics||5.0||This is a wonderful product. The surround effect is phoenomenal and I just love it. The extra $50 is worth it for the quality sound that it delivers
electronics||5.0||This is one of the best wireless phones I've had -- good call quality, good speakerphone quality and good range
electronics||5.0||I got one of these a few years ago.  It's been to several countries, on camping trips, bicycle trips, subways, etc etc and held together very well.  I pop this and the handspring into my pocket and off I go, not lugging around a huge laptop anymore.The typing is comfortable, this is just like a laptop keyboard, and while I too have worried about the little popup part where you connect the handspring, it's taken a beating so far.  I'm buying another preemptively because I'll be so bummed when I do eventually manage to break the current one.The hinge in the middle is annoying - you have to put the thing on a book or other flat surface to hold it in your lap.  I think that when the new one comes, I'll try to create some kind of deadbolt mechanism to hold the middle hinge when it's open and then it will be the single most perfect gadget ever
electronics||5.0||I saw the other reviews and was hoping I would have the same experience as the happy reviewers. Well, I got the cam and it was easy to install like they say. It just takes a little tinkering, with the PC options before you use it. With the mic and software it comes with, you get a lot for your money! If I bought a cam in the store, I would have been mad to lose out on this PC camera. It is SWEET
electronics||1.0||who would even think about buying something that plugs into the wall for sixty bucks! maybe thats why the ipod is so expensive...............
electronics||4.0||I purchased the Notebook Cooler approximately one month ago, after reading online testimonials of laptops becoming damaged from overheating. Thankfully, the same time I read that, Circuit City was having a sale on this item for only $15, after mail-in rebate. Fast forward one month and my opinion of the Cooler so far: not bad... My laptop is noticeably cooler to the touch now, and the internal fan rarely comes on. The Notebook Cooler itself is smartly designed, with an aluminum topping and two fans that draw away heat. I'll admit, the USB connector cable is a bit flimsy, and I can see why some folks have complained. For those users who travel frequently (or anyone who foresees plugging and unplugging the cable often), you may want to exercise extra caution. The blue LED light that some reviewer claims is too "strong" is a minor quibble--if you really wanted to, you could always tape over the light and problem solved. As for the fan noise, I would say the low setting is comparable to "white noise," which you don't really notice until you purposely try to listen for it! The high setting, on the other hand, is a bit loud, and I can see people having to turn up the volume on their speakers or TV to compensate. Usually, though, I only use the high setting when it's really hot in the room, or if I'm running intensive programs like Photoshop or some video game. Overall, I'd say I'm very satisfied with this product. (Though, I am somewhat disappointed that Antec needs 3 months to process my $15 rebate check.) 
electronics||1.0||These were expensive.....These are a P. O. S.If you dont know what POS is google it, because I cant say it on amazon. Basically, the layer has an OFFSET. The layers do not match in position. This will give you CRC errors if you have a file which is directly on a layer break, or at the end of the disk. DO NOT BUY, I REPEAT, DO NOT BUY.IM NOT SURE WHY MEMOREX HASNT RECALLED THEIR CRUMMY PRODUCT
electronics||5.0||To avoid burning a coaster, update the firm ware on your dual layer compatable drive first ([...]).  The Verbatim discs seem to have fewer compatability problems than the other brands I've tried.  If your home DVD player is not dual layer compatable, you may experience some problems.  It's normal for the movie to stop momentarily when it switches to the second layer.  For best results with movies, I burn these as slow as possible.  For data storage, they will burn at 8X no problem.  These discs work as advertised.  If you're torn between Verbatim and another brand, I would opt for Verbatim discs.  They really do work the best
electronics||1.0||Do not waste your money, this was under recommendations, but I would NOT recommend this with your Creative Zen.My daughter purchased this after saving up for an MP3 player, this just does not seem to give enough power, we plug it in and 12 hours later it is still charging. Plug the MP3 into the computer USB and it is done in less than 2 hours.It may work fine for some other things but not the Creative Zen. It would cost more to return and they will only exchange it, so guess we are just eating the cost and S & H. I should have read the reviews before; would have seen that you get what you pay for, don't waste your money
electronics||2.0||The iPod is cool but ours ... as we've found has happened to many other owners ... went on the fritz and our nightmare began. Apple's customer service is the worst CS that we've ever experienced regardless of the product or service supported. I could write for days about the awful experience but I've wasted so much time with them already ... I can't bear to waste more. The most notable point is that the iPod CS folks repeatedly stated that iPods are more or less disposable, commodity items and "breakdowns" were common. Wow!! .. $400 Bucks of throw away!?!?!? We still haven't recieved the return box for replacement/repair after several days even though it was promised in 24-48 hours. We also own an MP3 player that we refer to as a "Dell-Pod" from Dell Computer and have had to use their customer service as well. Dell's CS support was awesome. Based on our experience with Apple/iPod CS support ... this is the first and LAST Apple product that will be owned in our household
electronics||5.0||I've owned this headphone for about a year now, and I've got to say, after going through multiple headphones, this beats all others I've tried. If this one ever broke (I doubt that'll happen anytime soon), I'll surely buy another one again!Pros:- Comfortable to wear. The ear cushions are indeed comfortable to wear for extended periods of time. Even if you wear glasses, you won't feel uncomfortable.- Clear treble, middle, and bass. You can hear all the subtle sounds in your song clearly. Even with completely flat EQ setting, the headset does very good job with sound (provided you increase the volume up a bit more). As with any headphones, take time to 'break it in' to have it function the best it can (it means, to leave music playing on the headphone for very extended period of time non-stop, about 24 or 32 hours).- Sturdy wires. This headphone seems to have been designed based on recording studio-level headphones in this regard. The wire is very thick and long. Also, it's single wire format.Cons:- Ear padding is perhaps, too soft. This means it won't fully cover your ear area, and some of sound may leak out. So note that when you listen to your music loud in public places. Although, at first few weeks, the ear padding is relatively hard. If you are looking for a headphone that will ensure your music will never leak out, look into getting in-ear canal type headphones instead.- As some others have pointed out, tilting your head too forward or backward will make your headphone just drop from where it is at. So be cautious of your movements.- You might not want to wear this kind of headphone during summer due to poor ventilation. But this affects all closed headphones, so it's not a huge negative point.- The headphone is quite big and on a small head, you may have a difficult time keeping it up on your head. The size of the headphone is designed for a fully grown average adult head.That's all I've got to say, and overall, this headset is definitely worth your money
electronics||4.0||Nice sound, I will admitt for the price, I get big sound, with quality.  Only thing is a humming, hissing sound when machine is idle. Ohtherwise, worth it. 
electronics||4.0||I bought this item rather than the cheaper products advertised because I trust Toshiba and because the picture quality was better than average.  Overall, I am very satisfied with the product.  We have used it on several aiplane trips and my toddler is very entertained.  We haven't had any problems with the mechanics of the player.  We also bought a case (which I highly recommend) so that we have enough Baby Einstein to keep her happy to our destination.  Also, the battery has never run out, and charges quickly.  My only problem with it is that the volume doesn't go up loud enough without earphones to hear it very well in a roaring commercial airliner.  But, my daughter mostly looks at the pictures anyway, so it wasn't that big a deal for us. 
electronics||4.0||Unit's range shorter than expected, but I feel that I got what I wanted, and paid for. Shipping and delivery were great
electronics||1.0||I have a collection of over 1500 disks so I have bought many cd/dvd cases over the years and this brand is the worst quality on any that I have purchased.  I would avoid this brand.[...
electronics||1.0||It broke after two uses.  It has an auto shutoff if no detection after 30 seconds and I plugged it in to everything and it would shut off every 30 seconds.  I was so mad I threw it out the window.  What a waste of thirty bucks
electronics||5.0||I've had 2 other FM transmitters (A Belkin and a Griffin iTrip). Neither came close to the quality of this transmitter. Neither charged the iPod (The Belkin required batteries, which only lasted about 15 hours of use), while the iTrip worked OK at first, but then started getting static no matter what station I used. In fact, I had to have the iPod in hand for the static to go away (and then, it was still not clear). The sound isn't as loud as some (it takes over the volume control, so you cant use the volume on the iPod.) Still, it's not nearly as soft as some I've seen. I found most music came through at a good volume (I did adjust a few songs in iTunes to pump them up). This unit, although it seems cheap and flimsy at first, is able to get a consistant, strong signal, even on stations which usually come in clearly. It powers through them, and the result is a very clean sound. It is a little hard to read at the regular angle, but once you set the 3 presets, you don't need to see the screen. Just set your radio to the same 1-2-3 configuration. Also, turning it at a 90 degree angle lets you see the screen much clearer. In all, I couldn't be happier
electronics||4.0||I also ordered the Antec SX-1030 (which has yet to be shipped! arrgghh!!). According to Antec, the 1030 includes 2 fans, but has space for 2 more, which is where this one comes in! For those of you wondering what size "small" is, it's an 80mm fan. Good airflow (don't know actual CFM) and pretty quiet
electronics||4.0||I agree with most of the reviews here.  The PC155 is a great headset overall.  The sound quality is great.  Volume is more than adequate and fidelity is excellent.  I've listened to a great deal of MP3 music through these babies and I am very impressed.  Spacial/stereo imaging is great and I've actually heard things in the songs that I have never heard before!  It actually shows the imperfections of my MP3 and makes me realize that I probably need to turn up the bit rate when ripping my CDs.  The controls are also simple to use, both on the cord and on the PC.Audio recording quality is great as well.  I have tried it with Dragon and recognition works great with it.  Playback of recorded sound shows that the sound is a little on the dark side, however.  Ps and Bs are a little too hot even though I have tried different mike positions and used the included wind sock.My biggest problem with the set is in the comfort department.  I first feel obligated to tell you that I do not normally wear full coverage headphones.  Usually, I wear high-quality buds.  So, perhaps I just have to get used to it.  However, I feel as though my ears are being squeezed too much with these headphones.  Instead of feeling like they are comfortably secure, they feel as though they are too tight and they make my ears hot... even after only 15 minutes.So, despite my positive review of the sound quality, I am going to send these back and try the PC165.  They supposedly have bigger ear cups, which will hopefully translate to more comfort?  Other people here have not had problems with the comfort of the 155s so it is probably just me.UPDATE: I received the PC165 set and there is a big difference.  The sound is fuller and bigger (not louder) on the 165s.  Also, the comfort is much better.  They don't pinch my ears like the 155s.  The cord going to the headset is also thicker, which means fewer tangles and less chance of damage.  If you're thinking of the 155s, I would get the 165s instead
electronics||4.0||I bought these Ear Headphones primarily to use when running and biking at the club. The sound quality is acceptable, not exceptional. The construction is a little flimsy and the big issue is that the cord is shorter for the left ear than the right. That places all the force on the left side and that one tends to pull out. I have no idea why Sony thought that this was a good design. For the money they could also have included a case rather than a clip for the cord. I would give these a B- good/not great
electronics||1.0||I bought this router and spent almost two hours online with Linksys. After trying every sort of suggestion and speaking with three different tech support people who barely spoke English I finally understood that Linksys has "limited support for Macs." When I asked what "limited support" means, I was told "we are not trained to help people with a Mac. If you can borrow a windows PC we can help you". What a waste of time. I am sending the router back. Beware if you have a Mac

electronics||5.0||Hey, don't listen to those other schmucks. So maybe there are a few of these that are exceptable, but the rest just complain too much. I love this thing! I got it for Christmas, and now for $20, you can't beat that. I use a standard charger for it in my car, so I never have to worry about batteries. It seems that the best way to get it to sound the best, is work with your mp3 player or whatever your using (equalizer). I have also used it on my portable DVD player in the car and it sounds awesome! For the price, I highly recommend this product
electronics||1.0||We purchased this system less than two years ago.  It has seen light to moderate use.  Several days ago, the speakers started intermittently cutting out. This afternoon, the subwoofer popped several times--then caught fire!  Fortunately, my son was able to extinguish the flames before much damage was done.  Beware!!!!
electronics||5.0||Fantastic, take all the videos and pictures you want with the best quality
electronics||1.0||I posted a review two weeks ago, but it hasn't appeared, so I'm trying again...I bought this lock two years ago.  It has always been difficult to remove.  (Note:  despite what some other reviewers seem to think, it does NOT have a motion detector - that's a different lock.)  Recently, the lock decided to remain firmly inside my iBook, despite my efforts to remove it.  After a fruitless call to Targus's customer support, I finally got it out.  That took over 30 minutes of struggle.  My next step was going to be purchasing a hack saw.  Apparently, the Targus lock is not a good fit for iBooks.  I'm going to send mine back and demand compensation.  If you own an iBook, I strongly suggest you buy a lock made by someone other than Targus
electronics||2.0||I bought this printer about 4 months ago.  The prints are beautiful, and the speed quite good as well.  However, I felt compelled to write a review tonight because of the constant error messages that pop up saying that there are too many ink cartridges of "X" color installed.  It happens now between every print job, forcing me to open the printer, pull out and re-install one to three of the tanks, and then print my document.  There is something wrong with this thing, and I don't appear to be the first experiencing it.  Figures... I wait eight years to replace my printer, and end up with one that malfunctions! I will attempt to return this item
electronics||1.0||... it's called a leash. Or a fence. How about keeping your pet safe the responsible-- not to mention cheap-- way. I've been a volunteer at a no-kill animal shelter for 5 years, and I'm still amazed at the lack of guardianship people show for their pets. So your dog has this $350-dollar doodad on its neck. It's not going to keep it from running out into the street and getting hit by a car, or picked up by somebody who wants to use it for dog-fighting bait or sell it to a lab (yes, these things happen-- often). Have some sense, people. This is ridiculous. 
electronics||5.0||Fabulous product --- now I can store over 700 photos in the 8 mega pixel range.    Happy I purchased this one -- very trouble free
electronics||1.0||The software it is sent with is different than the instructions given, I have yet to get it to work with my laptop w/xp and a Ir HP laser jet. It may work fine for some cell apps phones etc. 
electronics||1.0||We tried the Belkin in one car. When we turned the Ipod on, the car battery immediately discharged (we had to buy a new car battery) and the Ipod died. We bought another Belkin and tried it in a different car and with a different Ipod (in case the first incident was a coincidence) and this Ipod died too. The Ipods were under warranty, the car battery was not. We tried this with 2 different Belkins, in 2 different cars with 2 different Ipods. I would not recommend this product to anyone.
electronics||5.0||This laser version tracks much better on odd surfaces compared to the Logitech V200 I have.The Setpoint software allows you to use Setpoint's mouse sensativity independent of the touchpad settings.  Finally!!!  I dont have to change mouse sensativities when I unplug it.  The Setpoint sensativity is an offset to window's sensativity setting for the touchpad.  So basically, set your touchpad sensativity first, then adjust the Setpoint sensativity.  They will be work just the way you want everytime you unplug/plug the mouse and going back and forth between touchpad and mouse.Perfect product
electronics||4.0||Very strong suction cup provides secure mounting. Quick and easy clip in and release for taking the GPS with you. Product would be better if the pivoting arms were longer and able to swivel sideways. Otherwise, this is a well-designed and quality product
electronics||4.0||This was my second DLO transpod. I had an older white one that I bought used. I figured I would "upgrade" to this one since my iPod and my car's interior are black. overall the thing performed similarly to my previous one, but with a few little changes.For one the output of this unit is much lower than its older counterparts. That normally doesn't matter if you choose a good empty frequency, but as you start traveling you notice interference much more than you would expect. Next, I can't turn it up any where near the volume I used to be able to on the older one without getting hissing and static. It seems that the decreased level on the output also increased the amount of electronic noise when using it.Last, the most annoying part of this whole product, is that it turns off the radio transmitter after a period of no use. I have paused my iPod to take a phone call only to have very loud (since the level is so low on it you have to make up for it with stereo volume) static and sometimes radio stations coming through. Very embarrassing. Or when you stop your car and then come back, as soon as the radio turns on you are met with the same very loud noise.Since my car doesn't leave me many options for stereo replacement, this is the best product for my specific situation, though I may try and get that old one back from my friend...maybe an "upgrade" to a newer one will settle the deal
electronics||1.0||I just cam from Las Vegas and the sandisk has a disk error that doesn't allow for more photos after only using 40mb. I have tried to format the disk using the camera and through Windows XP. It doesn't allow it to be formatted. Bad investment!!! Would not recommend the product unless there is a way I can get a refund or an exchange
electronics||1.0||My wife bought this as a gift for me, thinking that it included an FM tuner. For ten dollars more, she could have purchased a product that does everything this one does (it is essentially a $35 car charger) plus the tuner.  If you want to use this product to actually listen to your iPod in your car, you'll need to purchase yet another device: either the cassette adapter (old school! part F8V366-APL) or the FM transmitter (part F8V367-APL).  Either one connects through a jack in the side of this unit.  The FM transmitter is another $40 (you're now $20-30 over what the Monster iCarPlay, which does all of the above, would have cost you)...and, surprise!  The transmitter takes AAA batteries!  There's no way to power the transmitter through the Auto Kit.  To power the FM transmitter without batteries, you must purchase yet a third accessory, the "Mobile Power Cord for iPod" (F8V7067-APL, just $15!)...except your car's power plug is occupied by the Auto Kit, so you'll need to buy a twin-plug adapter for that.Are we having fun yet?  I'm not, and am wishing I'd skipped all this nonsense and just purchased the iCarPlay in the first place
electronics||5.0||I picked this up for 50 dollars to replace a 75-dollar Uniden that had a sticky "talk" button and muffled sound qaulity. The Panasonic blows the Uniden away. The sound is clear, crisp, and intimate, the ring selection is varied (I prefer the nonobtrusive default setting). The controls are easy to use. The quality and finish of the materials is high. I am now a loyal Panasonic phone buyer
electronics||5.0||This product is great - allowed me to connect a distant printer to my computer by hooking two of the extension cables together.  Worked right away - no problems
electronics||5.0||This is my first time ever buying a really expensive MP3 player.  I bought it three weeks ago.  If I hadn't seen the Creative Zen Vision:M, I probably would have bought the Sandisk Sansa E260.  I love being able to bring my cartoon/tv shows over to a friends house so we can watch them on the tv.  There is one problem I've had with it.  I'm not sure if anyone else has had this, but there is some slight static noise that happens once in a while when I'm listening to music.  I don't think it's the MP3s, because I've never ran into the problem with my other MP3 players.  If only they would've added the video cable for the TV and kept the charger, then I would've rated it a 5
electronics||5.0||I was considering purchasing a tablet and Wacom was consistantly recommended.  I was originally hesitant to buy the graphire line because I didnt think it would be very good for drawing compared to the top line (the intuos line).  I was pleasantly surprised to be proven wrong.  Installing a driver was a piece of cake and I began drawing away in minutes.  It is very responsive and works with all my drawing programs (paintshop pro, painter, photoshop).  The mouse is pretty useless however, and I would have preferred if they had included some extra pen tips instead (they seem to wear out, though I do press pretty hard).  Other than that, its an amazing product
electronics||5.0||This is a great printer.  I have used it several times and it makes great pictures.  I had some pictures taken at a low resolution and the print still turned out looking great.  Tried this on a regular printer and the print didn't look near as great.  A great feature is proof sheet print of the pictures you have.  You can also add a border to your pictures which makes things nice for postcards.Colors are great and vivid.  Also the prints look like that purchased from a photo shop.  I have not tried printing to non Epson paper so I can't say how prints would look.  I know that Epson printers look the best printed on Epson paper. 
electronics||4.0||I use this keyboard at work and as I am a medical transcriptionist, it is all I use all day l o n g . . .I really like it and I'm going to buy one for my home as well. It is very easy to type on and I like the wrist support
electronics||4.0||This is an awesome little MP3 player.  I enjoy both the MP3 player and the FM radio.  It is very easy to use and syncs well with Windows Media Player.  It is perfect for going to the gym because it is so small.  It came with a great leather case that fits it well and prevents damage and scratches.  My only problem with the player is that I can't fit more than 66-69 songs although it says there is about 70MB of space left on the player
electronics||5.0||I really like this mouse.  It is easy to use and is one of the most comfortable on my hand.  I have gone through a lot of mice and have finally found the one for me
electronics||1.0||I mistakenly believed the hype that this thing would PROTECT my computer from BEING KILLED, but instead, this thing has KILLED my computer FOR THE SECOND TIME IN 4 DAYS, EMITTING AN UN-STOPPABLE(i.e., CAN'T TURN THE FEATURE OFF) SHRIEK ALARM. How do smart, talented people idiotically convince themselves that a home product should have an ear-piercing shriek-alarm that can't be defeated / silenced? In addition to doing far, far more damage than it can ever prevent, ask yourself -- do you want this un-stoppable ear-piercing shriek alarm going off in your house at 2a.m.? I BOUGHT ONE APC PRODUCT, AND SO FAR, THEY'RE 100% DEFECTIVE AND 100% DELITERIOUS TO THE USE OF MY COMPUTER & IT'S A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE IT'S DELITERIOUS TO MY SLEEP.

electronics||5.0||This is a pretty decent cheapo case.  If you want something that you'll use every day in the car or at your DJ gigs, then you may want to get something a little sturdier.  For my [archival] purposes, however, it works just fine
electronics||5.0||I have had these speakers for over a month and I love them they sound awesome. They were delivered quickly and they were brand new as described
electronics||5.0||I have had this TV since Mid-March 2006. I absolutley love it!! I did extensive research before I bought a large screen TV and found that this Samsung seemed to give you the most bang for your buck. I read some reviews saying that DLP technology was plagued with problems from the rainbow effect, especially in movies with lots of dark scenes and lots of moving action. One reviewer specifically said to try playing "Bourne Supremecy" to see an example of the rainbow effect. This was the first dvd I played on this tv and I did not once have a problem with rainbow effect. Overall I have no complaints with this TV. Samsung has produced an excellent product. I recommend either satellite or HD programming for the best picture. Regular cable comes in sort of grainy.As far as where to buy it, I recommend Best Buy. I originally was going to buy from Amazon because when I first looked they were offering free shipping. When I decided to buy their was no longer free shipping, so off to Best Buy I went where they price matched me with amazon's price no questions asked. Best Buy offers an extended warranty for around $400 that covers bulb replacement or any other problems. It will also cover the rainbow effect on the slight chance that you have any problem with it. Overall a wonderful product
electronics||1.0||Unfortunately the item didn't work.  The company offered to replace it but I just decided to pay more and buy locally
electronics||4.0||VHS to DVD disc is just one easy setup. I set mine to record and recode just before I go to sleep. When I wake up a finished disc awaits. With the software tools that are provided you can sharpen and correct VHS that has degraded and bring back life as when it was first transfered to tape. I have taken many VHS tapes that were never released as DVD and now have the start of a great library. Editing is a little tricky until you get the hang of it. The product works well. IPOD old music videos and movies for a real treat. Sound is perfect
electronics||5.0||I PURCHASED 2 CARDS FOR ABOUT us$ 42 FOR MY psp they work Ok. I had other sandisk products and dont have any complaints. Best of all these cards came with the Adapter Memory Stick Pro duo to Memory Stick. So I could use it with my videocamera. Its nice when one company starts addresing the multiple formats problems.
electronics||5.0||I bought this package purely for the keyboard. I wanted a new one with wireless technology and I was driven to Bluetooth just because it is so reliable. I do not use the keyboard and mouse together, however.The keyboard is one of the most comfortable keyboards I've ever used. I am a computer programmer so having a nice keyboard is essential. The pad at the bottom is very comfortable and the keys are very well spaced and organized. The only real compliant is they cut some corners with the home, end, page up, page down, and delete keys. They moved them around from the conventional way which I still haven't gotten used to but it's fine.I have experience no lag with either the mouse or the keyboard. I play a game called StepMania (a sort of Dance Dance Revolution clone for PC) which requires very accurate timing with the keyboard. I've experienced no problems here, it's spot on and probably the fastest ever. The only problem, really, is it takes a while to register if you haven't use the keyboard for a while since it must turn back on from sleep mode and reconnect. After that however, there are no problems at all.I do not use the mouse with the keyboard. I decided to use it as a mouse with my iBook since it had built-in bluetooth. I had absolutely no problems connecting the two devices and it works flawlessly. I don't use the mouse very much, but the times I do use it I experience no problems.Both the range on the mouse and the keyboard are extremely nice. I can go anywhere in my room with either the mouse or keyboard and experience no problems.The battery life on the keyboard is also very nice, esspecially since it has the built-in sleep feature. I have had to replace the batteries once since I got the unit in January of 06 (currently June of 06). I have not had to replace the mouse batteries yet, but I do not use it very much.Others complained about not being able to use the keyboard in the BIOS or startup screens, but I haven't had any issues with that. It depends on how recent your motherboard is, and mine is relatively new so I had no problems.I highly recommend this setup to anyone wanting a wireless keyboard or mouse, or if you want to split and use the mouse with a laptop and keyboard with a desktop. Either way, you cannot go wrong with this package, it is extremely excellent
electronics||1.0||Don't waste your money. What iRiver doesn't tell their customers is that once the battery goes dead, the system is useless. I will never buy one of their products again and I'm doing my best to inform everyone out there that they'll be tossing their money in the trash by purchasing any iRiver products. My system cost me $[...] and it is now as useless as the customer service department at iRive

electronics||5.0||I recently bought an HP 17" widescreen laptop and needed to find a case for traveling. This case is all that and more...on one side is a detachable cell phone case...the other side a HIDDEN drink holder. It has a pocket that it slides into if not needed- that came in handy in the airport.This case looks extremely sturdy (well built!)and dirt just seems to wipe right off of it. It holds my 17" laptop, PDA, Cell phone, computer mouse, one-time-use cameras, Ipod, and all the wires and chargers for those electronics. I even fit two books, keys, a folder filled with directions and plane tickets, a notebook, and two dvd's in here. (all of that at the same time) Granted, all that stuff makes it pretty heavy to lug around the airport, so if you are doing that routinely you are going to want something with wheels or backpack form. The strap on this bag is extremely sturdy and cushiony. The strap was long enough for me to wear it diagonally accross my chest if I wanted, but it is not detachable (which means it isn't likely to fall off easily).This bag is extremely well-designed. There is a strap for attaching it to wheeled luggage...it even fits under the window seat of the airplane and those areas for storage are much smaller than the aisle seats. Very well padded..I knocked my brand new computer around a bit during the travels and kept opening the case to make sure it was okay! Of course it was fine because there are 3 heavy duty layers of padding.Because this bag does all that and more, it is large. It becomes larger the more you stuff it (obviously). However, I am 5'1" and I carried it fine from North Carolina to New York. It looks great, if I needed to go to a meeting with my laptop I would gladly take it in this case. It looks professional enough.happy buying!ps. let me add that finding a decently priced case for a 17" laptop that has all the features this one does is nearly impossible. Also, in the stores I checked this was sold for about 30 dollars more than here on amazon!! If you have a smaller laptop, this case will work just fine too! It has an adjustable divider. You will just gain more room for other stuff. I look foward to long usage of this case.

electronics||5.0||I just use the keyboard like a business user. I don't use the media stuff. I really like the tactile feel of the keyboard and how it works. I like that it's not huge and doesn't have all those extra ridiculous buttons that I never use. The rechargeable mouse is handy as well. Prior to this, I had two Microsoft wireless combos in a row, and in both cases the mouse gradually began flaking out on me. I don't know if it's because it's Logitech or it's bluetooth, but the keyboard/mouse are as responsive as were they wired (after they "wake up").
electronics||5.0||We previously had an AT&T cordless w/answering machine (1 handset) and always had trouble locating the one receiver - kind of like misplacing the TV remote. With 3 handsets, we are spoiled. Also our house has a few phone jacks but they are all located where we did not want a phone and no jacks in our den or living room. With the abilty to locate the phones anywhere in the house where there is an outlet, we were able to place one in our living room and another in our bedroom (which we can turn the ringer off).
electronics||2.0||I am looking for a system to replace a Siemens 8825.The 8825 has, in my opinion, the best set of functions of anythingcurrently available but I have some reliability issues with it. I first tried the Motorola 7081 and found that unsatisfactory. My next attempt was the Panasonic KX-TG6700B. This phone has decent volume and clarity at the base. The handset has good clarity and range but the volume could use a little help. The base layout is ok but the way you turn on the answering machine at the base is silly. The handset feels light and chintzy. The clarity of the outgoing messages on the answering machine is poor.  The base is ugly; what were they thinking? Anyway, it ok, not wonderful. But since I couldn't get the answering machine to save messages on either line (it's defective) I sent it back. Back to the drawing board

electronics||5.0||I live in Manhattan on the 7th floor of an apartment building surrounded by taller buildings on all sides and this antenna provides great reception. I use it hooked up to an HP 3200 lcd tv with built-in tuner. It took me less than five minutes from package being opened to finding the best place for the antenna to sit for reception. The cable is a few feet long and the antenna itself light. I have it resting atop my center channel speaker. $20 is a great price to watch the hd content the major networks provide- especially for football

electronics||4.0||I got the newer model of these, with the blue light on the speakers . All I can say is that these speakers are worth the money. You get what you pay for. These speakers have pretty good highs in them, bass wise there decent. They hit alright, and sub decent. You pay more money, you get a better system you know. This system here isn't much money, so it isn't going to be the best. So there isn't no reason for the bad reviews. I think they work really good for the price their tagged at. So if your looking for a system with some good highs, and decent bass these are for you

electronics||2.0||This phone is really cool but it has two major flaws. The first is the caller ID problem which the other posts have already described in som detail. The second is that although the incoming volume is fine, the people on the other end have trouble hearing me and say that i sound 'far away and very soft'. Troubleshooting and reseting doesn't seem to help. Will return ASAP
electronics||4.0||Needed better protection than my $10 surge protector for my HT setup now that I have a couple DVRs & a plasma.  Filtering would be a nice side benefit too.  Very little $$ more than the power-strip design units I was looking at (& now I see it dropped even lower!).Pros: Build quality, fit & finish, plenty of outlets & diversity of outlets for me, nice form-factor compared to power-strip design, cool looking LEDs & meter.Cons: Those cool looking LEDs cannot be dimmed & are too bright (esp the blue one!) if facing HT viewers.  I just blocked the LEDs w/a black card.  CABLE/SAT cable filtering no good for my digital cable provider (Cablevision)... Caused more artifacts on HD channels, so couldn't use the cable line filter.Bottom line: Seems a great deal esp at the new even lower pricing @ Amazon
electronics||1.0||I bought this and found that if you like to burn your own CD's to play in it, it has a problem reading the tracks.  It sometimes spins up and doesn't play, and it always has a very audible noise on spin up and track find.  I usually wake to that sound before the music starts.  I AM NOT A LIGHT SLEEPER.  This is my second one, and I've basically been using it for the radio wake function for the last few months.  Do yourself a favor and find a different product
electronics||5.0||This is a great little piece of hardware. I bought it for my MP3's and movies, and I'm very pleased. It's totally "plug-n-play"; there aren't even any drivers that need updating, assuming you have XP up to par. It gives 160GB (well, 149 in actuality) of space to work with. After moving nearly 50 gigs over to it at once, on the first day, it froze up. After that minor incident, I've had no problems, though, and my machine runs alot faster because of it. With my 100G of music already on it, I'm very happy with it. It has given me no fuss--it doesn't even give me any noise! It's as silent as a fart, and that's a big plus.I found mine at Wal-Mart for $114 and I think that I made a good purchase. If you're on a budget, this is about as good as it gets. Seagate's 300GB is also highly recommended, as I've worked with it before. A+
electronics||1.0||I purchased 3 of these APs with the expectation to replace 3 Cisco "b" APs and drop in. The setup used Radius for authentication which is claimed to be supported in both the online info and docs. After config (the web UI constantly has problems with cookies and forced you to re-login) the system would work. One quark was the IP address field for the radius server wouldn't accept more than one character in the forms. Up and running. However, upon reboot, the WG302 loses it Radius info and then cannot authenticate a client again. SHOWSTOPPER. After logging this with Netgear support - their response is this is an unsupported config and requires premium support. While this would be fine if it was a config issue, it's not ok given they claim support for these features and this was a required feature for purchase. They give no further support now.I would HIGHLY recommend against the extra cost of this unit given it's buggy and has poor support. Config is difficult (I had to learn how to use the command line config), the upgrades are not well documented (they imply you have to import some obscure file with tftp - you don't but...), however the unit does have good range and works (No RADIUS of course) in a basic config.
electronics||5.0||The reader is fast.  Example: I took 56-2MP images from my camera recently.  I plugged this reader into my G4, plugged in the card, the card mounted, I dragged the images to my Pictures folder, and they copied immediately.  No waiting.  I was amazed, because with my [MIA] USB reader, it could take a while to transfer that many images, over a minute.  A copy dialog didn't even pop up, because it transferred so fast.  It doesn't hurt that it's a cutie too.  5 stars

electronics||2.0||While a nice product packed with great features when it works, the bottom line is that it does NOT support TWAIN drivers, meaning you can not scan through ANY application other than ScanSnap. BIG MINUS. Second minus is JAMS, JAMS, JAMS. I have barely used this machine, but the double feeds are incredible (the rollers are new and the machine is clean). I even tried using high grade color laser copier paper, but STILL double feeds big time! Upon occasion, I get a good feed, and I am so thankful for that. If you are planning to do some serious office organizing with various types of paper, sizes and paper weights, skip this product and go for a ADF flatbed scanner. This baby will JAM up your day and consume all of your time with fiddling, reorganizing the misfeeds and clearing jams.Think deeply before buying this one. Also, with an ADF flatbed, you can scan books, and unusual documents (thin paper, very heavy paper) that an ADF (and the ScanSnap) won't process by simply lifting the lid of the ADF and taking the scan directly on the glass. With ScanSnap, you are screwed
electronics||5.0||I tried all the rubber vinyl plugs that came with the E3C's, but they all had the shortcoming of not effectively sealing the ear canal making bass very poor, and they were uncomfortable.  The yellow foam plugs are easy to use and work just like the ear foams many people use in industrial applications.  They effectively seal the ear canal and are very comfortable.  Although they seem a bit expensive I've found that once they get dirty you can use water and a bit of dish detergent to clean them.  Just soak, squeeze, rinse and let them air dry and they are as good as new.  You can do this three or four times, then just toss them away.  Highly recommended

I was worried that the four AA batteries would make it heavy to carry but it didn't matter when the device was sitting on my tray table. Besides, it was comforting to know that AA batteries are ubiquitous throughout the world. By the way, I substituted the original batteries with Duracells on the advice of previous reviewers

The picture is blurry, the lighting is abmismal in low light and you can just get better performance from a less expensive web cam.  I am still a Logitech fan, but you can get better performance from QuickZoom
electronics||1.0||I like other Lacie drives I've used very much, thought I'd take a chance on this, but it just does not work.  It takes me about a hundred swipes on average to get the biometric sensor to work...That is keeping data a bit TOO secure to be helpful.  Also there have been reports of complete data loss by others,but I've not had that experience - could be I just haven't been able to GET to my data enough to find out.  Support from Lacie was completely unhelpful (wash your hands and the sensor before swiping which I have already done dozens of times was the only suggestion).  If the drive could be partioned so you could have a secure partition and an easier to access partion, the failure of biometrics would not be so serious, but as is, I would definitely not purchase this again, and I would strongly advise against it unless there is some kind of firmware or other improvement
electronics||1.0||This version released late 2005 is obviously a cost-cutting result. This release drops the zipper which is essential when travelling.  Also the price have doubled compared to the previous style. 
electronics||5.0||This is a total bargain. Not only was the price right, it works perfectly in the car, at home converting every radio to a stereo system for my iPod Nano. When they're put together it looks like one unit and if, by chance, you use a Motorola Rzr phone the charger works with he iTrip and recharges the Nano, eliminating the need for any other charger devices

electronics||1.0||CONSUMER BEWARE!!!!This product does not work as advertised.  If you put more than 1000 songs onto this device, On-The-Go playlists cease to function.This is very, very sad for a player with 8GB of memory. It's supposed to hold over 2000 songs, but stops working correctly after 1000 songs are loaded?  Wow.  Unbelievable.This is a well-documented bug on the Apple discussion forums, yet Apple has neither acknowledged nor fixed this bug yet.  Will they ever?  Who cares?  Why should they, if consumers like you keep buying it and RAVING about it?I bought my 8GB Nano, but returned it two days later when I found out the problem was known, but not fixed and not fixable.Apple should not be shipping products with known bugs in them!  Don't they test these things?!?!?!By the way, the same problem also occurs on the 4GB Nano if you manage to squeeze more than 1000 songs onto it, which isn't all that hard to do...If you don't care about having more than 1000 songs, or you don't care about On-The-Go playlists actually working as advertised, what are you doing shopping for an 8GB player?  Better stick with your 2GB models..

After deleting all of the photos from this card, the capacity had suddenly decreased to only half! What happened to the other 1 gigabyte? I'm sure they pre-formatted this card to appear like it's 2 gigabytes, but what a surprise when you start using it. Not good

electronics||1.0||I bought these because I have an HP printer and figured they would be best for the shirts I want to make.  I couldn't get them to take for anything in the world.  I put the pressure on it, ironed them longer, everything you can think of and they still wouldn't take.  Then when I finally got one to take it completely cracked and crumbled and started peeling off before an hour was up. It never made it to the wash, so now I am out the money I paid for them and still have no shirts.  Any other brands you suggest instead
electronics||2.0||Don't listen to any of us.You already have an internet connection because you are here. Go to a browser and ask the question you asked here. You will find that any review that is NOT a store will tell you that ALL speaker wire is the same. They just look cool. If that's what you need, then buy it. Otherwise, stay away from monster. It's just like bose speakers.   BUZZ word, that's all. These companies can't make any money selling you a 10 dollar cable.

electronics||1.0||I went and got this keyboard after the first one broke.  I found the keys were re-arranged.  Instead of hitting home - I wound up deleting my work.This is a keyboard I cannot work with.  Model Number 1 and 3's were better.
electronics||2.0||Perhaps I got a lemon, but I feel wary of buying another DT200V for 2 reasons:1.  From the day I got it, the power button was so sensitive that a tiny waft of air (no kidding) would turn it off (or back on) at whim.  Right in the middle of a song, or talk, this shortly became maddening.Since this is unacceptable for a $50-range radio; and since I didn't want to spend as much money mailing it to and fro as it was worth, instead of sending it back -(OH looking back, how I should have!)- I opened it up myself, and had to physically shave down the plastic underside of the on/off button where it touched the internal power switch.  As I couldn't conversely move the guts further from the button, this was the only solution.Thankfully this worked, and the on/off button did not give me further problems after this.However,2.  Not many weeks or months of use in, the radio developed this habit of shorting out or something to where my pre-set stations just scanned as blank 'fuzz' (no station, not even 'intelligent' fuzz/crackle like it knew a station existed anywhere on the planet) and I could get zero stations of anything at all--not FM, not AM, and no TV.This would happen right after turning the radio on, and I should note that I always used headphones (not the ones supplied; as with most, throw them away, they're not worth it).  It seemed to me through trial and error that just turning the radio on was fine, but the act of plugging in some headphones joggled some connection or shorted something out, and did this.I tried several different pair and types of headphones (some with noise cancelling switches, some without, and with these On and Off), and used the 'lock' switch on the radio both in the on and off position while plugging in my headphones (as the company I bought them from recommended turning the lock switch on when changing batteries, to prevent shorts), but nothing I have done has prevented this from eventually happening again...repeatedly.It is really annoying when it does, as removing the batteries (which always will lose all your presets, by the way) and waiting several minutes rarely clears the short.Weirdly, the thing I've found which clears the short or re-makes whatever connection is messed up correct itself, is opening up the back (screwdriver required) and kind of pushing the guts (board) one direction or another, kind of scooting it (there's minimal movement available, though), and saying a little prayer and putting the whole thing back together again.  Most of the time, that has worked.  Occasionally, I've had to repeat the process 3-5 times before it will.Sometimes it lasts several weeks before this'll happen again, other times, it happens multiple times a day.  The day I can't fix it (I don't even know what I'm doing that's fixing it!), I'll throw it across the room, against a wall, and I probably _won't_ buy another one.(If I do, I'm keeping the receipt, NEVER opening up the back as it voids any warranty, and returning it (not for repairs--for a refund!) the split second it gives me any trouble of any kind.)For all this, I grudgingly say that it does have very good reception quality of FM (I almost exclusively listen to this), pulls the stations in nicely, and has very low amount of static.  When one particular station does, it's usually more the fault of distance, or we're getting out of range, or the batteries are very low- that's at fault.Indoors in a computer-saturated office-cubby environment and not near a window, though, I'd have to say, it has had some significant problems pulling in any more than 3-4 strong-signal stations without major static.  But your office environs may vary.  (Some are more electrical field saturated than most.)The FM (musical) sound quality itself is good/decent, and I might say better than many...but my 1 criticism on it is a certain 'canniness' of sound quality (across various headphones I've plugged in).  It's lacking some fullness of the midrange, and warmth.  Also, the bass is not what it could be.  I'm not sure given its overall sound quality signature if the addition of a bass boost button would have helped it or not.For me, clarity and volume have helped me ignore some of the lesser aspects of the DT200V's sound signature.  However, shopping for my next purchase, that will move up higher in importance
electronics||2.0||I've loved these headphones for the year or two I've had them.  I still love them now....  when they work.  The problem is that the cord is shoddy.  When I plug into my laptop I have a hard time keeping it working.  I have to twist the cord just right to get the sound to work.  If its not just right I'll get sound in only one ear, if at all.  I don't think this happened because of any handling issues seeing as how the base just sits on my desk.  I don't think it has ever left my office and I don't tend to put items on top of the wire that might crush it.  Overall I like these things, but I'm just getting sick of the sound phasing in and out when my laptop moves the slightest bit
electronics||2.0||I have to agree with many others about the poor quality of this phone.

electronics||2.0||These radios look nice but there are some problems here. First the batteries do not last long unless you do not talk. Second the biggest problem for me was uncompatibility with other radios and brands. The receive quality is very poor and hard to understand at times. I also hace a T7200 and the difference is like night and day. The 7200 is the best. The 7400 i believe is an has flaws and that is why you see them priced so low. I paid $24.00 on ebay and also have seen the set at home depot clearance for $44.00 today. What good is any radio if you cant understand what someone is saying? Good try motorola but this is a poor product.NOT RECOMMENDED TO PURCHASE
electronics||5.0||When I purchased this product I was a little sceptical, however, once I unpacked it and started using it, it was so absolutely easy to use, and the pictures have such a fine quality, and you can insert 4 different sizes of memory cards in addition to computer connection.  So, I see it as a win/win product.  The only draw back is the weight and size. I just do not regret this purchase with the price an added bonus as wel
electronics||5.0||I love this printer. I purchased it to print 8X10s from my digital camera. The ink doesn't fade over time like my HP did.
electronics||1.0||If you can't abide an ever-present low hiss in the background, and louder interference in the presence of power lines, don't buy this product.  I wish I'd read the reviews more carefully before I bought.  A number of even the most favorable ones mentioned this annoyance.The manufacturer replaced the first unit after I complained, but it was no improvement.  This may be the best product of its type out there, but it still comes up short.
electronics||4.0||On the plus side, it's a great value for the games that do work on the T5.  SimCity alone is probably worth the price.On the down side, although Amazon claims it's compatible with the "Tungsten Series" that was probably written before the T5 came out.  Four of the games appear to act as "trial" versions, although it's impossible to enter the registration codes.  See (...) for an explanation.Even with only 4 working games past the trial period, it's a good  buy.  Just know you're not getting what's advertised if you have a T5
electronics||1.0||Using this product to communicate between motorcycles as promoted by the very fact that there are motorcycle headsets for your helmut available for these radios is clearly unsafe.  The distractions created by the radios having no range after about 100 feet can prove fatal for a motorcycle ryder due to a momentary lapse in concentration, just as it would be between a bike and a car.I purchased these radios as the better of the Midland lot - with an 18 mile range.  An outright lie.  I bought them to communicate between two motorcycles- either myself and my brother (after also purchasing 2 of the motorcycle helmut headstets), or between me on the bike and my girlfriend driving my jeep following me on a long distance ride.  We don't even get 100 feet out of them when the radios begin to breakup and are usless.  The range increases as long as you are not moving.  I haven't tested them while one user is moving on the road or on the highway and one user sitting stationary.  I intend to contact Midland about a full refund, but if they don't work when you are moving then what good are they?. How could they fabricate these claims of 18 miles?  Even if they couldn't do 18 miles, how about a half mile?  How about 1/4 mile or 1/8 mile?  Not even that.  This is a discrace.  I'm just another customer handed a bogus deal.  Do not buy any GMRS stuff from Midland
electronics||1.0||Problem #1 - out of hte box, these units are assigned 192.168.0.10 as an IP address.  find if your network is on the .0 subnet.  So I had to change my entire network over to this in order to get it configured.Problem #2 - once changed, now i have Ip address issues because of the existing clients picking up the .10 address.Problem #3 - If you incorrectly specificy the SSID/wep key or IP address, you have to put it back to the defaults and start over.  there's no way to configure the unit Problem #4 - it just plain don't work as it should.Easily the most difficult unit i've ever had to configure.  It's a shame that I'm swearing off linksys as their prices are good.  Despite it's decent price, stay away from this one
electronics||2.0||I commute via public transportation, the majority of that on a noisy train. Earbuds and over ear headphones don't block out enough of the noise to enjoy the music. I received these Philips HN110 headphones as a gift. When I first got these I was pretty disappointed at how flimsy they appeared. I have some KOSS over ear head phones which are nice and beefy. These are scrawny but on the other hand take up less space. They use a single AAA batt. Using them on the train I was able to turn down the volume on my music player a tad but a lot of the noise still gets through. I'm not an expert on these but I guess this noise cancelling works mainly on lower frequencies. Alot of the noise on the train is higher in pitch and thus gets through. The next thing I noticed was that with a cord coming out of both the left and right earphone you are limited in how you can put these on and take them off. My KOSS and Sony headphones and earbuds use the single cord to one phone and the connecting cord from there (or it runs through the headphone band). I realize I like this single cord feature very much. Again these Philips HN 110 don't have this. I also noticed that when the Noise Cancelling is turned on and the wind is blowing you can hear the wind as if it were amplified. After about a month and a half the battery compartment door latch broke inside. Now I can't open the battery compartment without doing some damage to these headphones. I checked Philips website for info on these phones but I couldn't find any. I called their customer support and they told me I had to call a different #. I called the different number and got the Return Merchandise Authorization # but was told I need to send the receipt in. I got them as a gift so I don't have the receipt. In summary, their noise cancelling ability is pretty week. Better than my hefty non-noise cancelling KOSS over ears or my stethascope like Sony ear buds but only by about 10% or so (just to put a number in their). Flimsy design. Cords from both earphones. Hear the wind amplified. Battery compartment latch broke after a month and a half and their warrenty sucks

electronics||4.0||I am running the RadioShark on a G4 PowerBook w/ Mac OS X 10.4.  I am very happy with the programmed recording - saves to a variety of formats, etc. Very handy! The unit did all that it promised, but it could have had much better software. A Dashboard Widget is also included that controls basic operation, but not recording or EQ.Needed additions:1. Station presets are selected from a drop down menu??!? One has to go to the RS menu bar (top of screen) to find the favorite Stations - kind of klunky. Better to have "radio buttons" associated with the App window. To be fair, the Widget does have better station selection, but the button is labeled with a 'heart'...2. No station "scan" function. One has to dink through the entire spectrum manually - wow - hard to understand this lack of functionality.3. Some additional audio filter/edit functions could be included. There is a multi-band EQ that works well, mostly (see comment below). At minimum there should be a hiss filter and a hum filter with variable levels of effect. Also, one should be able to edit out unessential material from an audio file. Though, for Mac OS X there is a nice freeware app that can do this:  AUDACITY.Oddities1. When first installed, the output had static in it which was worse with the EQ on. Griffin Tech Support was not very helpful - as with most tech support offerings, they failed to grasp the actual problem and replied with unhelpful suggestions. Re-installed software and it began working well.2. Initially did not seem to work well thru an external (powered) hub; now has no problems. Though, unit does work okay with a USB extension cable
electronics||5.0||I totally recommend this mouse. I purchased the 1st mouse a few months about and just now bought another one for my other laptop.  I like it that you have an assortment of colors you can chose from also. The battery life is pretty good also
electronics||1.0||I recently bought this keyboard to go along with a fancy ergonomic laptop stand.  The stand puts the laptop screen at a reasonable height for use on a desktop -- that works great.  The keyboard, however, is fairly awful, and I'm returning it.I realize I shouldn't expect much for $20, but the keyboard has an exceptionally soft, mushy feeling.  The "comfort type" slanted keys didn't get in my way, but they didn't help anything, either.  The worst part about this keyboard, however, was that it uses a non-standard layout.  Look closely at the right side -- the "enter" key is oversized, and the |\ key is moved below to accomodate it, with the consequence that the right shift key is miniaturized.This, for a shell user or programmer, is awful.  When you need to pipe something, or escape the next character, you really don't mean to be hitting return instead.  And with the small right shift key, even typing properly with balanced use of the keyboard is difficult.  This small design decision makes this keyboard terrible for heavy computer users like me
electronics||5.0||Great product for getting all those old home videos on DV
electronics||1.0||The first subwoofer died (no sound) after 6 days.  Remember, the sub powers all the speakers in this system.  I sent it back to the company I bought it from and they were nice enough to take care of "Klipsch's faulty product".  They asked me if I would like a refund and like an idiot I said, "No, just send me another one".  The replacement Klipsch system arrived and it played great for about 14 months and then NOTHING.  No power from the sub!  Same problem but now my warranty is up.  Klipsh has a way of designing things to work just past the warranty.  Shame on Klipsch for making such a shoddy product.  Shame on me for asking for a replacement and getting burned twice.  Heed all these warnings my friends.  I would buy used speakers at a garage sale before I would buy another Klipsh product.  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!    
electronics||4.0||No problems w/ the phone. There is no mute button and it's annoying to hit two buttons to mute/unmute. I also couldn't find a way to change ringer volume but it's easy to change the ringer melody and there is one that's really soft. The menu is not as intuitive as it could be but overall it works just fine as a phone.
electronics||1.0||Here is the original review of this machine I wrote on June 17, 2006:We bought this machine just over a year ago (a year and two weeks, to be specific).  We had another very similar Panasonic DVD recorder (DMR-E55) in a different room and wanted to be able to record and watch DVD-RAMs on both.  For a long time, the ES10S recorder worked fine.  Recently, though, it has begun making noises when starting up and shutting down, and now it occasionally has problems reading the disks, ejecting them, and even playing them.  At first we thought this might be because we'd recorded over the DVD-RAMs so many times.  But today we tested one of them in the other machine, which has never made any similar noises, and the E55 had no problems with it.  Needless to say, we're not happy that the ES10S seems to be dying, especially since the 1-year warranty just ended.  If you buy or own this machine, follow up on any strange noises as soon as you hear them if you're within the warranty period, because the noises and problems just get worse.  Panasonic is usually a reliable brand, one we've used for many years, but this machine seems to be a lemon.  We're actually going to write to Panasonic about it--I'll try to post again with the results.Here is my update, which I wrote November 3:This is a follow-up review to the one above, which I wrote on June 17. I wrote to Panasonic after my machine had stopped working just after the warranty ended. They sent me a nice letter authorizing a free repair, including labor, of the machine at one of three places they listed. The places were all within a half-hour drive of my home. After doing some research, I chose one and brought in the machine. They fixed it by replacing "the entire internal mechanism" (I don't know what that means). We got the machine back from the repair shop near the end of July; it's now the beginning of November. The fixed machine worked fine for a while, but in the past few weeks, we've been hearing the same old noises that were the beginning of the end for it before. I'm going to try writing to Panasonic again and asking for a refund, because this machine really seems to have something fundamentally wrong with it. It's still working, but I know from the last time with these noises and efforts to read the disks that soon it won't. Avoid this machine. Again, the previous Panasonic model (DMR-E55) we bought hasn't had any of these difficulties and continues to work great. We're still big Panasonic fans, but this particular model is a lemon.
electronics||5.0||I've never written a review, but I've relied heavily upon the voluntary opinions of other Amazon buyers, so I felt a really good product like the Anycom Bluetooth mouse deserves an unsolicited review.I know experience and taste vary by individual, but this mouse is awesome from my viewpoint.Pros:- Bluetooth - connects immediately; provides smooth accurate tracking- Size - very portable; some may find it too narrow; I have a hardtime going back to a wider mouse- Battery life - I get at least 2 days out of it before charing and I'm a fairly heavy user- USB charge attachment - allows you to continue to work while recharging- Product Design/Quality - Nicely engineered; good quality material- not tinny - it's built to take abuseCons:- Haven't really found any - It took me awhile to figure out how to connect until I read the manual line by line (I don't tend to do that) then I realized it was pretty straight forward.If you're looking for a quality bluetooth traveling mouse this is the one.
electronics||5.0||After having used CRTs roughly the size of small cars for my entire life, I finally jumped on the LCD-flatscreen bandwagon. This Acer 19" LCD makes me happy I did!Mostly using my computer for gaming and movies the color, brightness, and size of the screen really matters to me. This monitor really nails all three of those areas. It provides vivid, crisp colors; it doesn't wash out the picture with super-brightness (what my old monitor did), nor is its display too dark to catch the action; and the 19" screen seems to have the perfect balance of immense screen size yet incredibly low desk size
electronics||2.0||I really love my Garim GPS 12. It is easy to use and move between screens and features. The Summit is not as easy to use. It is not as convenient to identify way points, does not work with mapping software and its display is to simple. It was not a step up but sideways. I use it in conjunction with my GPS 12 mostly just to keep the track log
electronics||5.0||Don't let the reviews fool you. At this price, it's worth a little research. Apparently U3 is annoying a lot of people and the people at U3 have created an uninstall download for you to get. So Google it, download it, and buy the USB drive. The size of this USB drive and the fact that you'll never have to worry about losing the cap along with an excellent price make it worth buying. After you uninstall the U3 software, it works like any other drive. It works great, it just takes you ten minutes of a little extra work. I'm very satisfied so far and have carried audio, video, and a lot, lot more  on a drive the size of a pen cap. Brilliant...
electronics||2.0||I replaced a Siemens 8825 with the Motorola 7081 and was, unfortunately, really disappointed. The 8825 while rich in function, is quite lacking in quality. So what's good about the 7081 is:1.	Great design and feel, especially the handset.2.	Nice look to the unit.3.	Well-lit displays.4.	Easy to understand voice prompts when accessing remotely.5.	Reasonable range.6.	Nice feel to the buttons.7.	Fairly easy to go through the setup.8.	Ability to sort the phonebook alphabetically.9.	Base has phonebook that can be shared by the handsets.10.	Motorola customer support (excellent).Now what's not good:1.	Even at maximum volume, you can barely hear the speakerphone on                         the base.2.	Sound on the handset is distorted, fuzzy. The person on the other        end hears a hiss. The volume is adequate, but barely.3.	Cannot search the phonebook. If you sorted it alphabetically and        need to access a name starting with "Z" you have to scroll through         the entire phonebook.4.	Can't record an outgoing message remotely.5.	Battery level indicator on handset is useless. When the handset is         in the charging cradle, it shows a charging indication at all        times. When it is out of the cradle, it doesn't show anything.I really wanted to like this unit because it has such a nice look and feel to it but the poor sound quality is a showstopper.
electronics||4.0||We bought this about a month ago from Amazon.  The product itself seems fine - we used it on a vacation drive from NJ to Myrtle Beach and back.  At times, it was a help (like when there was a traffic jam on 95 in VA and we needed an alternate route).  However, you definitely have to keep an eye on it as it doesn't always recommend the best or shortest route.  Also, it was missing certain stores, restaurants, etc. that had been around for awhile.We liked that it is a PDA though.  My husband drives limos so he wanted a mapping device for help but we hope to load some games into it.  This way, when he has to wait around, he will have something to do.  CONS: - You should be tech-savvy to get one of these set up- Match sure you get patches as unit will lock up- Manufacturer has DISCONTINUED this model.  They still offer some support but be warned that this is a DISCONTINUED model.- Since it became DISCONTINUED, it dropped in price about $60 two weeks after I bought it which annoys me somewhat- Will be spending extra to get bigger memory card- Came with EXPIRED Outlook coupon - why bother including this?PROS- Nice display and controls- Came with mount and dock (some don't - you have to buy extra)- We had no trouble with the suction cup mount (had to pry it off the window with a knife one time) but agree that most placement seems to block driver view through windshield- Also a PD
electronics||1.0||I never even got a chance to listen to music through these headphones.  I couldn't get them to stay in/on my ears.  The loops that go around your ear are huge and just make them more cumbersome.  These may fit men with bigger ears better but I wouldn't recommend them for females
electronics||5.0||As long as I own a pair of these headphones, I will never use bass boost or a graphic equalizer again.  They sound PERFECT.  I cannot fathom a more balanced, natural sound.  These babies put you in the recording studio, or in the concert hall!  Bass is crisp, taut, and strong. You can feel it. Yet it is not overbearing or boomy. Midrange is balanced so well that you'd swear you were standing next to the lead guitarist, and the treble is so crisp and clear that you will rediscover the percussion sections of your favorite tunes. The folding feature is handy.The only things to be aware of are the following:  First, you have to break them in.  They start sounding better after a few hours of use.  Second, they don't have an inline volume control, which I will dearly miss from my Koss KTXpro1s.  Finally, plenty of sound escapes.  So don't crank them too much in the library or at Grandma Edith's funeral.  Other than that, you have no excuse.  Put your iPod's lousy white earbuds in the garbage disposal where they belong, and order these (or if you don't want to fork out $40, order the Koss KTX Pro titanium phones - which are almost as good as these, and definitely the best in the sub-$20 price range.) 
electronics||5.0||I have this card for a week, and what I can tell you is that this card has a quality that I've never heard from any sound card - the sound is so clean, balanced and accurrate.of coure, you will need a good set of spekaers.the CMSS surround is much better than Dolby Prologic 2 and DTS neo 6 for both music and movies.if you plan to connect the DIN cable for Integrated speakers control with the Megaworks or Gigaworks, you should know that it's not working, but Creative is going to add support for those speakers in the following drivers.I didn't like the new 24-bit Crystalizer sound, but belive me you will not need that feature, just use good mp3 player like Winamp 5+ MAD mp3 decoder plug and ASIO plug for the output.I had many sound card like the Audigy 2 , Audigy 2 ZS, Audigy 4 Pro, ESI Juli@, M-audio Revolution...and none of theme even close to this card!!!worth every $$$!!!!I recommend you buying from amazon beacuse of thier great service and warrnty, I could't do that because I am outside USA
electronics||4.0||The product is fine however when i ordered i added a gift card to the payment. The gift card was not used and the purchase was paid in full with my credit card. Is my gift card still valid
electronics||1.0||I purchased 2 sets of these earphones for a 2 hour flight. My husband and I both used them, and we both took them out of our ears after 20 minutes. They were great at first, but after 20 minutes they really started to hurt our ears. The inside of my ears were so sore I couldn't even adjust the earphones when they started coming out, that's how bad my ears hurt. I had the foam pad over them too, and it made no difference. I would not recommend these
electronics||5.0||There is absolutely nothing that we don't like about these Panasonic phones.  The sound quality is excellent as is the range.  Very happy customers
electronics||5.0||I tested my new Canon i960 with a variety of papers. Like most printers, the output is much better when using the manufacture's own paper (as opposed to the cheaper generic paper), but there is no need to buy the most expensive "Pro" paper as neither I nor my wife could discern ANY difference between the two. There may be a benifit to the "Pro" paper that cannot be seen (lasts longer?) but at almost twice the cost it is not worth it - this paper will produce the highest quality prints on your Canon printer (I think they look better than the ones I get from the photo lab)
electronics||1.0||Hi! I bought my Cyberhome 300 in April 2006, and was able to set the region code to "0" to watch all DVD's. After not using the DVD Player for a few weeks (and unplugging it), the region code has automatically set back to "1" and I cannot change it anymore! What happened?? When I try to change it now I can only choose between the settings "1" and "-". Anyone who has the same problem? Thank yo
electronics||5.0||I thought I was going to have to try to track down some headphones for kids until I ran across these!  They are super comfortable and seem to block the world out.  I've been using them for about 3 months now and couldn't be happier eventhough I've got a healthy dose of ear wax building up on them
electronics||4.0||A lot cheaper than model-specific docking stations, and 'does what it says on the tin'. Quite stylish too, as docking stations go
electronics||1.0||The transmitter doesn't work. I tried everything I could think of to try and make it work but it doesnt
electronics||2.0||The first warning sign is that the drivers are not Windows approved and unsigned. Their installation instructions advise you to ignore the warnings.Next, is the cheesy "cool" looking set-up program. Please forget about the groovy graphics and just provide a usable interface.Then, the drivers don't work. My cursor slides all around the screen after I stop moving the mouse. I tried calling customer support, but there is no telephone support. I then tried connecting with their online chat support. No one helped me after 20 minutes. Two days later, in response to an e-mail, they sent me 3 pages of instructions about how to adjust my system to accommodate their crappy software.Too bad, because the mouse itself is a nice piece of hardware. Solid-feeling, well-built, and comfortable.I'm sending mine back for a refund
electronics||4.0||I wanted a combo and this seems to be the best one on the market now days.The mouse is very good, a tad small, but still very comfortable. Not as good as  Logitechï¿½ MX(tm)500 for my hand (I'd say I have a medium size hand), but still a very solid product. Side buttons are very useful. No need to install any additional drivers for XP if you are ok with the default behavior. Just plug it in and use.The keyboard is so-so. It is not bad, but just not very comfortable, especially compared to Microsoft keyboards. (I use Microsoft 4000 for work and it really shines). The labeling is very small, Insert/Delete keys are not standard and I hate Vista ready button, if you hit it in the middle of the game you are lucky not to crash.Would I buy it again? Yes. Would I recommend it? Yes, but with some reservations.
electronics||1.0||This warranty is purchased through Amazon, but it is actually distributed by another company.  When you search for TV warranties on Amazon, you will see 4 warranties that appear to be the same, but are different prices.  I called the company that sells these warranties and asked what the difference was.  They told me that there is no difference between the $119 warranty and the $499 warranty; they cover the exact same thing.  The girl I spoke with even asked her manager and he said there is no difference.  Warranties are a tricky item to review, because it all looks good until you actually need it.  So, on this one, I suppose only time will tell.  The one difference between the Amazon warranty and the electronic store warranty is that the Amazon one will not replace the first bulb in the TV; but I figure if I need to replace the bulb within those four years I will still be saving $100 because I can get a new bulb for around $200.
electronics||4.0||I do not have a hearing problem, but my previous cordless phones were inaudible even at high volume.. this phone fills the bill -- at least so far!  The only caveat: no speakerphone, which would be handy considering the amount of time most of us spend on hold.
electronics||1.0||I am sorry to say that my experience with the CD player has been miserable. After a series of unhelpful conversations with SONY folks, I am going to return it. It often fails to read the CD or cuts in and out on new CDs that play perfectly in other CD players; the shuffle program simply spins and spins, and rarely settles down to actually play a CD.  It occasionally generates a read error message (uh, yeah...).Even if on "continuous" play, it often fails to recognize the CDs loaded into it. Instead, it displays a "No Disc" message. Then, even if it does play a series of CDs on continuous play, at some pt, it just stops. It has been like this since I first brought it home and has not improved in the weeks since.   The experience with the tech support people alone convinced me that they do not care.  It took a long time to even get through their tech support lines the first night I had it, and then a lot of persuading to even get them to agree that their CD player was not working. Then they tried to convince to me send the brand new machine back, **for a price**, to have them repair it. Uh, no, not likely to fall for that--paying them to repair a brand new machine straight out of the box, taking time out of my way-too-busy life to ship it to them??  I finally have a reference number with permission to return it to the store for a full refund; so back it goes. Then there are the limitations on the remote control that others here have noted. Since I had the same shuffle problems with my previous SONY carousel player, I am not inclined to try a 3rd machine. Needless to say, no more SONYs are coming into my life. 
electronics||4.0||The camera is perfect.  If using the camera for keeping in touch with friends and family this is the camera for you.  The picture is clear not to grainy.  The only heads up is lighting.  Try to use the camera in a well light area. We are stationed in Japan and use the camera almost daily to spend time with family back home.  The camera has added great joy to the family especially when feeling homesick.  The best part is the price won't break the bank
electronics||5.0||This phone was an additional phone for the Model IP811-2 phone system used for Vonage. This system has every feature that I could want, including range and quality, there are no negatives. I am highly recommending this phone and system
electronics||1.0||To back up my personal DVD collection I burned 200 discs.  100 on these Memorex DVD+R's, 100 on Philips DVD+R's.  EVERY Memorex had flaws during playback.  EVERY Philips was flawless.  I've been buying Memorex for years but I'll never buy Memorex again
electronics||2.0||I bought these cables, brought them home and immediatly hooked them up.  I set the PS2 for component and set my TV for it as well.  And  it looked awesome....for about 2 weeks.  Then the short in the cables caused only the blue and green colors to work making everything look creepy.  It would just fade back and forth until it just stop and the TV would have all the colors washed out in green.I found that I could stick a PS2 case under the cables at the base and it went away.  But sometimes someone would move the case and it would come back.  I have the PStwo (Small version) and the PS2... the small version has the problem, but the large one doesnt.  So dont get them if you have the small version... The large one works fine. 
electronics||4.0||I found this on clearance at another retailer (I guess not everyone likes pink), and it's fabulous.  I thought it might be just for skinny-armed people, but not so!  I've got plenty of room, it fits great, and it doesn't move.  Still looking for a solution to keep the earbud cord out of the way, though.  Makes mowing the lawn WAY more fun
electronics||2.0||I like the HP 96 because it can be used in many HP printers that use the HP 98,  but its a better deal than the HP 98 because it contains almost twice as much ink. HP's ink cartridges provide excellent performance,  but I think they are over priced 
electronics||1.0||Great looking keyboard. Unfortunately all it takes is one minor spill and the keyboard is destroyed. That includes cleaning. And don't think you are ever going to take it apart and dry it. The keyboard self destructs after you have the, count them, 10s and 10s of screws.I called their customer support. They weren't like DELL, nobody is that bad, but their resolution was to buy a new one from them for 50% off their retail price. shipping was extra. So you save maybe $10 off street prices.All-in-all they are no longer the good company they were in the past. They need competition. So I'm pulling out my old logitech from retirement. Too bad they don't make those old keyboards anylonger
electronics||4.0||Amazon has a nice price on the JBL Duet Speakers (July 2006 - 36.95) dealmac is a site I used and returned to amazon.I purchased these for my office desk where I wanted a crisp sound for low volume daily listening. Anything from Ambient, to Rock and Jazz. They produce sounds nicely, nice tight crisp. If these came with a woofer unit these would be ideal speakers, as the 2-pieces alone do not produce any significant bass at all. Just the "hints" of bass in the music but no thud, if that's what you are hoping for. I did turn these up loud to listen to their full sound and they do sound good.  These are perfect for offices and just daily music, sound is superb. Not for audiophiles or for people who are expecting to shake everything on their desks. Build quality is "ok". I got the white speakers and they are the nice "Mac" white plastic. The JBL logo on the speaker itself is awfully big. And the silver volume knob is made of that cheap silver flake paint over plastic which is abit tacky. One of the soft rubber pads on the bottom of these (meant to not scratch your desk) did fall off during opening but they are glued on so no big deal in placing it back on.  The design is very modern and cool tho. They look nice on my desk.You will need to keep these on for abit to let the speakers fully... break in. They sound awful right out of the box and after maybe one hour of keeping these on they will sound better.On the low end of speakers out right now, these will probably sound the best and are most modern design, compared to the black boxes out there
electronics||5.0||Great product. It's two in one. You have it in your camera and take photos, next you can plug it into the USB port and download data. It's worth the money
electronics||2.0||I bought this player a little over a year ago, mainly for the ability to upgrade the firmware to region-free. Played everything I put in it until a few days ago, when it started having intermittent problems- graphics were staticy and blocky, sound would just buzz and it wouldn't eject discs until I shut it down and restarted it. That lasted for two days before the problem became permanent. Now it's a doorstop.  The Apex web site appears to be down right now, but based on the other reviews here I doubt there's much point in contacting them
electronics||1.0||These Ear Buds are large and hard. They have sharp edges and hurt my ears. I have large ears and large ear canals and wear other earbud type headphones all the time which do not bother me. These were not only painful but did not enhance the sound, but actually reduced it. This product should be taken off the market
electronics||1.0||I bought these batteries on what was writen on their packaging. It was not true to what was said. These batteries died after only 25 minutes in my digital camera. And a set of Duracell Ultras, that are not rechargeable, lasted longer. Do not always believe what you read. Make sure you have the ability to return items. And is with this case, they went back. I went with a set of energizers. And they last much longer, with the power being the smae as these 1800mah monster brand
electronics||1.0||Can't say much for the video or sound quality, menu options, or anything really, since this thing broke after 2 minutes of watching Monsters, Inc. on DVD.  Playback just froze, the thing stopped recognizing that DVDs were in unless you turned the thing off and then back on again, and after another minute it wouldn't even start  playing the thing at all, just whirred a lot.So, dud
electronics||5.0||I did buy a set of 2 "Base station and extra handset". Its a great design, tons of features, MP3 ring ton, Picture Caller ID, Sync with your PC for phone book, Answering machine, etc.I am very happy with.Thank you so much for such great product with a great price
electronics||1.0||I've had it for one week only and I'm using 3rd pair of Duracell batteries right now! I was using it for 3-4 hours per day (I have another mouse at work). Stayed switched off for the rest of the day in order to save batteries. Nice mouse when it works.. Mine is piece of junk, maybe the latest batch they've got was not up to standard. So I totally agree with Mr. Loftin.. And it's silver one in my case, not a black one I've ordered..
electronics||1.0||The remote control is OK.But the earbuds are horrible! They are very sensitive to your particular "ear anatomy". I suppose they fit for some people, but for me they are useless. They stay in for a few seconds, but don't dare do anything like running, walking, or moving your head and expect them to stay in.Much better to get lightweight headphones with an over-the-head or behind-the-head band, or even the models with "hooks" that fit over the top of your ears.
electronics||5.0||I received the correct Q5949X cartridge.My calculations for cost per page is only 2 cents per page, which is contrary to another reviewer's claim of 12 cents per page.$120.00 divided by 6000 pages equals 2 cents per page.
electronics||5.0||Have been using them for a week now. Incredible sound for the size.  Bass is incredible.... mids are accurate, highs are accurate.  These are the way to go if you're using an MP3  player.  I use them with the Creative ZEN Vision M 30 ("The Ipod killer")  While walking, riding a bus or train in in N.Y.C. seals out external noise amazingly VERY WELL!!!Pros:Awesome accurate sound / Incredibly light / don't protrude out of your ears / comes with "2 sets" of three different sizes of silicone  plugs / plugs are ultra soft, comfortable and fit perfectly / secure well built storage case / cleaning tool / barely uses battery power! / Not the yup-tard WHITE COLOR.... much cooler BLACK!Cons:  None so far.I bought them directly from Amazon for $75.99 with "free" 4 day ultra fast shipping
electronics||5.0||This was part of my Stereo update. I selected this receiver for quality, value and ease of operation. I matched it up with the Sony CDPCX355 300 CD player and a fresh pair of those Bose 301-V speakers. Years ago I used to be an audiophile and I now think I'm going to enjoy getting back into my hobby
electronics||1.0||These disks would not work with my Sony brand DVD writer. I have tried several other brands and so far everything works but Memorex.
electronics||4.0||I just purchased one of these and was a little sceptical after reading some of the reviews that stated how difficult it was to load the information into the unit. I had no problem at all. In fact it was quite simple. I am truly amazed at how acurate and easy to use this unit is. For the price, you can't beat it
electronics||5.0||I,ve seen complaints about the ac adapter you "must" plug in. Hey guys, try it without an outside energy source, I just hope I,m not gonna fry something but it seems to work fine just plugged into a powered USB port. I have a VERY high end system though with wattage to sprare, but no more PCI slots, Damn 7900 512 gtx graphics cards, why do 2 of em have to take up so much room. Oh well, trade offs are a bi---, but a reality and 7 extra USB slots are awfully nice
electronics||5.0||Works great, good quality from Belkin as usual. Hard to beat for the money
electronics||5.0||These mini CD-Rs work great in our Sony Mavica CD Cameras at a cost of only .42 cents apiece
electronics||5.0||I have been using this card for last 6 months, no problem so far. Rebate takes some time to arrive
electronics||5.0||When i first came across this particular microphone i had my doubts. Considering the price of it i just couldn't see it holding up for what i wanted to do. to my surprise this mic exceeded my expectations. For recording vocals this mic is amazing. a real professional sound for a extremely low price. i definitely recommend this mic to anyone out there looking for an in expensive way to make professional sounding material
electronics||1.0||Bought this a month ago for use with my DX4330 kodak 3MP digital camera. It worked for 2 days.After that, everytime I on the camera, it wanted me to reformat the card,WTH is that?Now I can't use it at all....I'm always so confidence with my previous purchases from Amazon.One mistake I made,I threw away the shipping and product packages once I tested out the card, thought It worked and It would be OK.I can no longer return it now.Needless to say,I'm too over confident with LEXAR's products.Buyers beware...
electronics||2.0||Note: I am fully aware that compact flash cards have a maximum sustained upload speed which caps off the potential speed of the medium it is being transferred on.I purchased this product to use in conjunction with my SanDisk Ultra II compact flash cards.  I thought that PC cards would be faster than USB 1.1 and 2.0, but thats not the truth.Whenever I try to upload files from my CF cards thru the PC card, it slows down the ENTIRE system.  I can't do other tasks while the card is uploading files since everything is acting sparatic and slow.I'll admit, the card is a bit faster in uploading files than USB 1.1, but I can't do anything else on my computer while the card is working.  Honestly, I would rather have a little bit slower performance with my USB 1.1 card reader and be able to work on my computer at the same time instead of having the card slow down my entire system.I believe this card is a 16-bit pcmcia card.  I've heard good praise for Lexar's 32-bit pcmcia cards, but I have yet to try it out.  I'm sure it costs more money than this PC card or a USB card reader, though...All in all, I suggest getting a USB 2.0 compact flash reader over this product if you want to work on your computer at the same time as you are uploading files.Otherwise, if your the kinda person who doesnt mind leaving the computer alone while the files are uploaded to your computer, this will work just fine for you
electronics||5.0||I bought four of these.  So far they appear to work well.  They do not work with compact flourescent lights well, but are fine with incandescent bulbs
electronics||1.0||Wow this is a real piece of junk if you have any other wireless devices going on in the home.  And who nowadays doesn't?  There is so much noise you can't even hear yourself think.  Oh well lesson learned.  If I could have given this device a zero I would have.
electronics||2.0||Worked well when it was working...massive bass response, comfortable cushioning for big ears and funky styling. Only complaint is the cumbersome battery case and cheap feeling plastic construction. However, none of this mattered when it just stopped working 4 months after purchase. Gave absolutely no signs before hand, just working one day, completely dead the next. There are other reviewers here that shared my same fate, so if you want to gamble with these, go ahead, but know that the risk is a pair of dead headphones. 
electronics||1.0||I ordered the Passport X50 from Amazon to save the $18 shipping Escort Radar was charging. I was told by someone at Escort Radar that Amazon was an authorized reseller.After having my detector on for ten minutes (right out of the box), it did three "SELF CAL"s, then said "SERVICE REQUIRED". I called Escort Radar and was told "If you let the car power up the unit when you start the car, the voltage can be all over the place and the unit gets confused. You must first start the car, and then use the thumbwheel to turn on the detector." It makes some sense, but if this is really the case, why don't they put those instructions in their manual? After trying this many times, the unit was "still confused", so I returned it for a replacement.My second detector worked for maybe thirty minutes before the same thing happened. This time Escort Radar told me "if you leave it plugged into the cigarette lighter over night, this has been found to cause problems." Well my lighter power goes off when I turn off the ignition, so this doesn't apply. Escort Radar also told me that "excessive heat" has been causing them problems. Now we have had a few days of 100ï¿½ heat, and I'm sure the car gets hotter parked in the sun, but the design engineers should have accounted for these conditions plus some margin when you design something that is supposed to work in a car. It gets a lot hotter in other parts of the country. There are no warnings in the manual about not using it above 90ï¿½ or leaving it off in a hot car. You wouldn't design a ski that doesn't work below 35ï¿½, would you???The most troubling part of my conversation with Escort Radar service department was they told me Amazon is not an authorized reseller, and they have no idea where they are getting the units from. Furthermore, they will not honor any warranty nor will they ever repair the unit, not even for money.
electronics||5.0||just got this one at sears, and was only $20 so i grabbed it. the Canon A400 i have only came with 16mb so i needed more space. the 128 is much faster and easy to format than my old one. love it!!! go out and buy one today! GET SANDISK NOT LEXAR, THEY BREAK ALL THE TIME!!!!!
electronics||5.0||I have been using these fans for the stalls in our horse barn for years. It keeps the flies away and cools down the whole barn. The barn is dusty and the fans collect a lot of dirt. I wash them down each year and they are like new. The fans I have now are on their third barn year. In a normal house I'm sure they would last forever. They are a little noisy, but the horses don't care
electronics||4.0||It doesn't have spectacular bass power, but I am happy for the product I got at such a feasible pric
electronics||2.0|| These headphones are so expensive and they are aweful! I dont remember if it was the left or the right but one side of the cord is longer than the other; its very annoying! I tried to loosen it and the wire was showing, what a piece of s***. Its very annoying because the ear bud fell out when I listened to music and it doesnt feel comfortable. Also the rubber on the ear bud falls off very easily. They are too expensive for a piece of junk! The only reason I rate it two stars is because the sound is great on the headphones. Instead purchase the Sony SRF-HM01V S2 Sports Walkman Street Style Headphone Radio. I purchased those after these fell apart and they are much better :)
electronics||4.0|| the speakers sounds excellent for it's price but the power button has a defect. you need to push it a certain way to power it on
electronics||1.0||I ordered 2 of these, realizing they would have limited adjustment range - other reviews are correct in that they are very limited in their travel. What prompts my one star rating and subsequent return of my order is that they will not hold their rated weight. This model is supposed to hold a 25 lb. monitor; it failed miserably at attempting to hold my 23 lb. iMac. There is no tension adjustment (already as tight as it would go) and the computer just flopped forward. With a light monitor, I'm sure it would be fine, but don't expect even close to the stated 25 lb. rating. 
electronics||1.0||Most people buy a UPS, plug it in and never test it to make sure it works. I tested this device a number of times to make sure the software would at least shutdown the computer after an outage. I set it to shutdown Windows after 1 minute. Only the computer and a few small phone accessories are attached to it. After power was cut, it held the computer up and allowed it to shut down. Then I restored power to the UPS. AFter about 30 seconds, it beeped, clicked, and temporarily DROPPED power to the computer while it was rebooting! So when it switches back from battery power it causes power to be interrupted. That is unacceptable. A UPS should never drop power to the attached devices after power is restored to it.
electronics||4.0||I found out the way to copy photos from my CompactFlash card onto the iPAQ. It's not hard but more complex than necessary. I also found out how to send the iPAQ in to have its screen replaced. A hassle. Its screen and/or stylus should work together so they don't produce scratches in the first place
electronics||5.0||you can never go wrong with this paper. I always buy it here, the price in stores is outrageous
electronics||1.0||I bought four of these and returned them immediately. Two were dead out of the box. A third had horrible sound.After searching the internet and reading a variety of reviews for similar products I finally settled on the 900 Megahertz Wireless Intercom from Radio Shack. (43-3102)Beautiful sound. Well made and about half the price of the Reporter. Pretty much the same featues but it only claims a range of 300 feet as opposed to 1000 feet. So if you need more than 300 feet for range it's something to consider. Better warranty than the Reporter as well and for 8 bucks you can extend that warrarnty for another year.Anyway I couldn't be happier with the RS intercom. I just can't recommend the Reporters given that 3 out of 4 units that arrived were faulty
electronics||5.0||This is my first HOTAS, but I did a good bit of research.  It is very easy to set up, and the SST Programming is very helpful setting the shift key.  The joystick is easy to move, which is nice in a close dogfight.  I am very glad that I bought this HOTAS, because I have had NO problems with it.  I highly recommend this system to anyone

electronics||5.0||I have used this 128 MB XD Memory card and it works fine.  The pictures are good.  I have had no problems.  I now have this memory card and the standard 16 MB card that came with my camera.  Good deal.
electronics||5.0||Product-wise, the card has worked fine, but then memory cards generally either work or they don't.  Product was shipped in a timely manner, and the price was reasonable
electronics||4.0||I have long struggled to find the perfect remote.  The URC9910 isn't it, but its pretty good.  Its no match for my Harmony 880 but it also costs a whole bunch less and works through walls.  I have 2 URC9910s, both programmed identically for my main HT.  The cabinet also contains a second reciever and a sound distribution center for the other rooms in the house.  The kids can be using one URC9910 with the TV/HT and I can be in the basement or outside and control the volume of my music with the RF part of the second URC9910 remote.  For the price you can't beat it.  All buttons AFIK are progammable or mappable.  Setting it us is a pain and I had to find some pretty obscure codes on the internet to get my TV to do its thing so that is where it looses a star.  Otherwise its a great performer and with the price, I don't mind if my kids use it, whereas, they aren't allowed to use my Harmony 880.If cost is no object, then there are better remotes.  For the price, I can't find one better
electronics||5.0||I've been a gamer for almost 20 years.  This is the best mouse I've ever owned.  It is fast, accurate, well formed and constructed.  I would definitely recommend it.The DPI adjustment is a nice touch.  I prefer corded mice due to cordless being to heavy, this mouse is just right
electronics||4.0||For the price is is great.it's working fine but the plastic is not solid and has a feeling of low quality. 
electronics||5.0||This TV weighs a ton, took three adult males to pick it up off of the floor and load it into an entertainment armoire. I have owned several Sony TVs and really thought hard about this purchase because of firmware issues that I have had with a 27" Sony. Mainly compared this model with the corresponding Panasonic Tau, absolutely hated the Tau remote and am very familiar with the Sony. Note that the remote was not the deciding criteria, but it was a consideration. I have no real complaints about this TV, the menu system is nice and the picture very good. I do not normally use the built-in speakers so really can't comment about their sound. This TV has a 16:9 enhanced mode that must be selected from the menus, I tried it once using a DVD as source input and liked the widescreen format that the DVD player provides better than the 16:9 mode. The 27" Sony that I have has an auto-volume feature, this 36" does not and I do miss it. I would purchase this unit again. Note that there is a very similar Sony model that has upgraded sound, but not consider it because the added width would not fit in the armoire
electronics||4.0||nice little system but only 4 ohms so doesnt handle a lot of power. Good sound for an apartment
electronics||1.0||This flash drive does not work with Windows 98SE. The back of the package clearly states you can download drivers for Windows 98SE at the maufacturer's web site. First I tried downloading the driver. Turns out the driver is a .zip file so I had to download WinZip so I could unzip the driver. After downloading the driver and WinZip the flash drive is still not recognized by my PC. The FAQ at the manufacturer's web site states if the device is not recognized the BIOS on my PC must be enabled. But the FAQ doesn't tell you how to enable the BIOS
electronics||2.0||I initially chose this router because of its low price. Sometimes, you get what you pay for, and that is exactly what happened to me. As a wired router, this works well enough. It connects four computers to the internet. Just don't do anything to intense with it, and you should be fine. I noticed that when I view video media, the connection totally freezes. But for basic internet and downloading, it works.I generally find, however, that no one buys a "wireless" router not to use wireless, and that is where the problem is. The receiver is so painfully finicky, it does not keep connections. The configuration of this router is about as easy as brain surgery. The linksys support team tries to be helpful, but I can't seem to make this router reliable. It drops reception all the time. Many times my laptop won't even detect a signal. The wireless performance of this router is abysmal. I sincerely hope that if you have this router, it is working flawlessly for you. I can't get it to work well for me not matter what I do. The difficulty that I am having with this equipment is so bad that I am going to replace it as soon as I can.
electronics||2.0||The description indicates that it works on Mac platform. But it does not. And the funny thing is the instruction.It says "if it does not work, try different computer." Very helpful, isn't it?So I had to use my PC and set up a network w/ Mac and trasnfer. Too much trouble if you have a Mac.However, it's easy to use. Hook up and click, click. that's it.

electronics||1.0||I just purchased yesterday the Home Dock Deluxe for list price at a local retailer.  I read all the reviews, (most of them bad but I got it anyway) the menu on TV part being my motivation.  And so far, I am not feeling good about buying it...1.	The sound quality is very poor.  Almost every song has some distortion and sounds "muffled" along with a good hiss.  I thought I was listening to a 70's era cassette it was so bad!  I have a high end Sony/Infinity system and the poor sound is very noticeable.  In desperation (and checking to make sure my amp was working fine) I plugged in my Apple dock from my 4th Gen Photo 60gb and the standard Apple AV cable.  The sound problem disappeared, and was crystal clear.2.	The menus to not work properly.  My Nano 5gb seems to work OK, but my 60gb 4th Gen Photo does not.  The menus are rather slow, and the artist, or album, or song titles disappear at random.  Sometimes you can back up a level on the menu and you will see the data, but mostly it is just blank.  The cursor will scroll down as though there is data there, but nothing shows on the screen.  You can play the music from the blank screen, but it is pot luck as to what you will play as you cannot see any titles.  I like the idea, but VERY, VERY frustrating.3.	There is NO support at all from the DLO website. It just lets me download a PDF of the manual or to buy more accessories.  I did not even bother contacting them due to all the problems.   I am not impressed.  4.	There also all the other problems listed elsewhere, too light and build quality poor, annoying power LED on front, no artwork on TV menu etc...5.	So basically, it is WAY too expensive.  Not worth it.  Not even worth 10% of the price charged.I should have listened to all the comments above, and not believed some of the "official" reviews on the web.  So it is back in the box and ready for a trip back to the store.  I guess my lesson is that I should trust the reviews
electronics||4.0||The 4GB high speed memory card is the best it is fast and it can store so much data I cant even imagine using all of the memory but the only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it's over 700
electronics||4.0||Wish the unit had a separate online/offline light.  When power to the unit is missing, the single red light turns off only when the warning sounds.  The warning sound is like a lot of sounds you hear in the house so it isn't always easy to tell what is happening
electronics||5.0||i used canon ink and then decided to try one of the cheap imitations. it worked well for a few months and then my photos came out of my canon i900d with color changes. after 3 conversations with canon customer care, we decided it was not the printer, but the cheaper ink. i switched back to canon, bit the bullet on the price, and everything is fine. i found decent prices on amazon, particularly at eek industries
electronics||5.0||A great solution to theft prevention for this GPS. The legs fold up to make a compact unit that easily fits into the glove box.As for the grip on the dash, it works very well. There is a little bit of creep on slick dash boards, but it sticks better than the Garmin bean bag on my 2720.
electronics||5.0||I bought this phone at Amazon, and I am happy with it. Provides very good sound quality, comfortable navigation,address book and Caller ID.With its 5.8 GHz frequency speed, it is much better than my previous one which was Panasonic 2.4GHz and did not have light signal on handset when you have a new message. 
electronics||5.0||This is a great swicth with low price.  I use it together with D-Link DI-704 4-port internet sharing router to build my home network with 1 PC, two servers, one PowerMac and a laptop connected to cable modem ISP. Connecting via the swicth for internet sharing doesn't show any noticeable slow-response as compared to connecting via the router directly.  It works well by itself as we as with D-Link DI-704
electronics||5.0||I had a little trouble getting my system to recognize it when first set up...but after a little tweaking, it works beautifully.  Previously owned regular CRT...what an improvement!  Superb clarity and brightness.  For the money you just can't go wrong with this one
electronics||1.0||I bought this since it's economical, compact, didn't need cabling (although it has an extension if you need it), advertised a whopping 108 mbps. Well so much for that:1) Drivers are problematic and causes conflicts with XP SP2.  My first ever blue screen of death in about 3 or more years running XP came this item2) It is EXTREMELY UNRELIABLE:- already mentioned repeatedly, it overheats- it drops connections randomly and yes, the only way to re-acquire the signal is to unplug and plug back in- It's utility is worthless, just install the driver (if you can). If you try using WPA, forget about using this utility, just use Windows to configure it. - I've also found out that it's better if you just remove this utility from the STARTUP (don't run it at all) so that Windows can do everything it needs to connect, which is faster and more reliable. Be careful not to UNINSTALL, since it will also remove the driver...just remove it from your Windows Startup folder list. Netgear has an FAQ about this problem, but I'm not going to tweak Windows and risk more stuff for this cheap piece of hardware.3) 108 MBPS? Yeah right. You'll need the RIGHT KIND OF access point/wireless router for this, if not, it's 54 mbps. This was one of the selling points, but it's definitely a "gotcha". You're limited to specfic equipment, specific channel (6), so if you have neighbors on the same channel, well, you get the picture
electronics||1.0||I knew I had to pay shipping for this cards ($5) so I decided to buy 4 at once, what was my surprise that at checkout they wanted to charge me five dollars shipping for each card eventhough they were going to be ship together I decided not to buy them anymore. They lie telling you that you are saving a huge 1% but at the end you pay almost 20 dollars for each card that is more or less 35% more than anywhere else. Its a shame that they try to rip you off that way. BUY THEM AT THE APPLE STORE ON LINE, NO SHIPPING FEE !!!!!!!! YOU PAY ONLY FACE VALUE NOT A CENT MOR
electronics||5.0||This phone is small, great battery life, awesome range, and no interference.  The features are subtstanial and the quality is amazing.  From one that has always had Uniden Cordless phones this is a substantial upgrade. 
electronics||1.0||You don't have to spend a fortune on expensive cables when you are dealing with digital signals.  Keep in mind that all digital interfaces have error correction built into them. Did you know the internal components of consumer electronics are connected with tin and nickel?  There's no gold inside!  So there's no need for oxygen-free, gold tipped, multi sheilded, super mega supreme cables.   If you don't believe me, buy this cable and a no-name cheapie.  Compare them for yourself -- you will see no difference.With analog signals, a good quality cable may make a difference (although the difference is usually only visible on an oscilloscope).
electronics||2.0||No free lunch & you get what you pay for...is that the verdict on this product?Well, the poor rating given by those who have purchased this product has discouraged me from buying it.  I need disc binders and the Case Logic brand, while being the original, is pricey.  Low cost alternatives are needed, but not at the expense of quality and TCO (total cost of ownership).  But the flap about poor customer service (rebates) and poor quality (zippers and sleeve binding) is enough to give me pause.....  So, if someone from Xtreme's management is paying attention....fix it or be content to lose business.  Price isn't everything to everyone in the markt for your product..

electronics||4.0||As the title states, this is an excellent wireless mouse.  Works right away with Windows XP, no driver install or software needed for two-button and normal scroll capabilities.  Software allows for extra button assignment, but could use some work.  I have had some trouble finding the menus I want when I want to find them.  For example, I have an issue where I cannot find the extra button assignment menu after plugging in the USB receiver after a system start-up, however I am able to find those menus in the software if I remove and reinsert the receiver.But as I said before, superb mouse function and tracking...this thing works on upholstery, leather, my jeans, and thick carpet!!
electronics||4.0||This CF card is perfect for anybody who needs a high capacity (e.g. for hi-res pics) but doesn't care about the transfer speed. It may be a bit annoying though - especially if you try to download all the 2GBs from the card to your hard drive because it takes some time. I do still consider it a real good purchase ;
electronics||5.0||I think everyone knows that these drives have become invaluable.  Mine has become a necessitiy between my computers at work and at home and any where I can get an open computer.  I have W2K at home with USB 1 and XP Pro at work with USB 2.  Never had any type of compatibility issue.  This 128 MB size is the minimum most can get by with in my opinion.  I plan on upgrading to at least the 256 soon.The amazing this is that I have just removed my USB drive from a clean pair of pants that went through the wash and dry cycle.  And this was the second time.  I can't believe it still works.Maybe I'll have to start using that ridiculus cord and wear it around my neck.Through away your zip and floppy disks and get one of these things.  Just make sure you back it up often
electronics||5.0||I bought this because my windshield suction mount could not be trusted.  I've had it fall off more than once.  Then you drive around wondering if your $700 Nuvi is going to fall and break.  Not Fun!  The friction mount works for me. For everyday driving, even aggresive driving, it stays put.  Someone on this site left feedback about using it with their Nuvi 360 and I used their review to make the purchase.  I'm glad I did. 
electronics||4.0||I ordered v8 as soon as it was advertised by Garmin but they shipped v7 instead.  Six weeks later I got the v8 update dvd.  My wife and kids had to make due with v7 while in Madrid.  She was pleased with the accuracy and said it enabled her to travel around with confidence.  However, she noted that Madrid was undergoing quite a bit of major road construction and she got stuck in multiple traffic jams on the major highways.  In the end, she would veer away from the major roads and let the unit re-calculate her route. 
electronics||2.0||I was in the market to upgrade my printer and used Amazon's reviews to decide on a Canon MP530. It does a good job, but when I plug the USB cord into the printer, the connection to the Internet drops every time. I have to disconnect from the printer so I can get on-line. Recently I filled out a rather lengthy application on the Internet and plugged in the USB cable so I could print. That step caused the connection to drop and I got to reenter all the information. I will be returning the Canon MP530 and start my search for another all-in one printer

The design of the working end of the whisk allows the head to reach every bit of the pot but without my having to twist my stirring arm into a knot. Since the head is hinged, it lies flat in a drawer which is a good thing, too

The photograph depicts a different type of ironing board than the one the cover actually fits.  I bought two of these and had to return them both as they did not fit the board.  I was stuck paying the shipping, thus penalizing me for a product that was misrepresented
kitchen & housewares||5.0||This All-Clad ladle is a beauty you'll wonder how you ever did without. Before I bought this, my drawers held only gravy/sauce ladles. You know, those short little things that'll fall down inside your pot and your soup. Buy one of these and suffer that fate no more! Now that I own this, I truly enjoy preparing big pots of stew or soup. You'll feel like a real chef when you dish up portions to your family or friends.
kitchen & housewares||2.0||After going thru several $20 dollar blenders in the last 10 years I decided to splurg and go for the Kitchenaid. Well it didn't last even as long as the cheap ones. The motor is still good, and the blades are still good, but they used a little plastic coupler between the two and it lost all it's teeth one by one. We mainly like to make milkshakes and smoothies about 3 or 4 times a week.

kitchen & housewares||1.0||I have tried to purchase this item since May 2006. Without explanation, after my order was processed and I was given a date of delivery the order was cancelled and I received a notice that the  board was not available.How strange is that? If you call the company they tell you the item is availble through Amazon.Would really like to understand what has happened.I feel somewhat less unhappy since I read a review of this very pricey item saying it was not worth the cost.
kitchen & housewares||1.0||I feel it was an unlucky day when I bought this pot.  As careful as I tried to be, it was extremely difficult to tell if I had correctly placed the stem (with basket) in the pit.  It had to be by "feel," and half the time it was apparently a hair's breadth off and would not perk.  Or it would perk enough so that the light went on but that the coffee grounds were hardly wet.  It was also difficult to correctly jam the plug into the pot.  A hair's breadth off and again it wouldn't perk.  So each day became a guessing game as to whether today would be the day I got real coffee instead of cold water or damp coffee grounds.  I am returning to my old friend, the Farberware FC280.  It may or may not last more than a year but at least I can depend on it
kitchen & housewares||5.0||These work great to get that extra out of the bowls. I am very particular about my spatulas. I love Pampered Chef items, but do not care for their spatulas. They do not seem to slide very well. The MIU ones slide easily on all surfaces

kitchen & housewares||2.0||I was very surprised at how large this grill was when it arrived; way too large for my countertop at least;  it just seemed like more trouble than it was worth; it seemed easier for me to just broil food in the oven frankly; I mean the only thing you are going to get from using this grill is the grillmarks on your food; nothing can duplicate the flavor of cooking on an outdoors grill; the size turned me off as well as the inconvenience of using the product.  It is one of those products that you will use once or twice and then it will end up lost somewhere in your cabinets
kitchen & housewares||1.0||I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my mother.  I was very excited when it arrived much sooner than I had anticipated.  I opened it up, so that I could give it to my mom assembled.  Unfortunately, an entire corner was broken off and the other corner was cracking and splintering.  The packing materials are insufficient to say the least.  I immediately called target's customer service, and the operator very graciously assisted me in returning my table.  Despite my dissapointment about the broken table I was glad that Target did the best they could to resolve my issue without any hassle.

kitchen & housewares||5.0||*****I bought two sets of four bowls to complement my nice set of everyday dishes for times when you want just a little bit of something---like a little yogurt, or some granola, some fresh raspberries---and we use them all the time.  I agree with a previous reviewer that they would be wonderful for food prep.They are not thin, as a previous reviewer has noted.  They are not thick or bulky either, though, just perfect.  They seem like they will last a long time and wear quite well.  They almost look, well...elegant, which seems kind of cool for just Pyrex and for the price.  The bowls come well-packaged, and although the price is very low, they definitely don't seem cheaply made.  I haven't seen them in stores, either.  Great buy!****
kitchen & housewares||1.0||The design features for the on/off switch is a good idea if you have dry hands and are prone to dropping things.  Otherwise, the on/off switch is not good at all.  The button is hard to press down and is a trigger type switch that does not allow for the blade to be left in the on position.  You actually need to keep a lot of pressure of the switch to keep it going.  The blade was sharp for the one and only time I used it.  I took it back right after Thanksgiving

kitchen & housewares||1.0||I thought it was a good deal to order a "Factory-Reconditioned" Roomba 4210 Discovery to save some money, however...It arrived!  I excitedly opened the box.  First impression...  The unit was dirty, very heavily scatched and scuffed.  Not exactly a good first impression.I then lifted the Roomba out of the box and I was immediately covered with dirt and dust.  The bottom of the box was also filled with dirt and dust and hair.  I flipped it over and discovered the brushes covered with dirt, dust and someones (or somethings!) hair.I was grossed out, but even worse, the other person in the room (who suffers from allergies) started to sneeze violently.  I spent the next 20 minutes thoroughly vacuuming the entire room and all other horizontal surfaces I could reach.I think it is very obvious that NOBODY did anything with this Roomba since the previous owner returned it besides transfer the polystyrene packing box to a new cardboard box that says "Remanufactured" on it!In summary - BE VERY CAREFUL!!!If you ordered a "Factory-Reconditioned", be aware that it might be pre-filled with someone elses dust, dirt, hair and who knows what else.I think I might have to bite the bullet and pay full price.  I like the idea of this product, but not the pre-filled one I received
kitchen & housewares||2.0||First, when you use the temperature probe, the meat temperature shows on the display. Also, it is very easy to set the temperature alarm. However, there is a small switch that must be turned on to activate the alarm. Good for one burned roast. Granted, a mistake you will only make once.Second, when the timer gets to zero, the alarm sounds, and the timer switches to an elapsed timer. A very nice feature. However, there is no way to shut off the alarm without stopping the timer. It will eventually shut off after one ear-splitting minute.Otherwise, it works

I used the fryer only once because the lid did not seal properly and I ended up with oil & water from condensation dripping down the side.  I returned the product and received a full refund.  The safety plug was hard to use and the basket size is too small for more than two people
kitchen & housewares||2.0||With 3 different speeds you think you would able to make a shake or smoothie in this machine with no problems right? Nope, I am always running into problems with ice getting stuck around the blade assembly, and I do mean stuck!  I have not had this blender for very long, and I really don't use it very often either so there is no reason I should be told my blades are probably dull - its not like I was making a brick smoothie! AHH..  Also why does the lid stain so easily - I have never made anything that contains purple in my blender ans now my lid is permantly that color!  The best thing I can say about this is that it is heavy so it stays put, and the lid has a really tight seal which is not good if you have limited mobility in your hands.  I have since purchased a differnt brand and have no problems!  Looks the mixer is the only thing KitchenAid has perfected

kitchen & housewares||1.0||I've had this kettle for less than 2 years. After reading good reviews, I decided to purchase this kettle because I wanted something that would last with daily use. I disliked it from the beginning. Why? 1) It's heavy. 2) When you open the lid to fill it with water (you shouldn't fill it just through the spout because then all the deposits are on the wrong side of the filter), water that has collected around the lid leaks out and runs down the outside of the kettle. 3) After less than 2 years of use, it is no longer working properly. It constantly switches off during heating. I've had better use from a cheap plastic kettle, and will be going back to using one of those
kitchen & housewares||5.0||I have recived serveral comments on how good these knifes look. I am in fact very pleased with the way they look, but even more important is how well they perform. They cut wonderfully (for me at least, but I'm used to cheapy knifes). Yes they will in fact rust, although I haven't had this problem with my set (had them for about four months now) because I only handwash them and dry them immediately.  One steak knife found it's way into the dishwasher and sure enough it came out with a little rust spot, this was easily removed with a little steel wool.  You just have to weight the benefits of the all metal knifes to those that are wood handled or plastic
kitchen & housewares||5.0||I am not sure what the folks who left negative reviews did wrong, but we got it right the very first time and boy did we ever. We made it a family project on a Sunday night- my Wife, my [...] Daughter and Myself. We froze the pot over night and all day and got it out Sunday evening we poured in our mixture in less than 1/2 hour the alarm sounded, the light turned green, my Daughter gleefuly  pushed the dispense button and out came delicous vanilla softserve. Clean-up not so bad either. We love it. Good family project

kitchen & housewares||5.0||I used metal muffin pans before, the muffins will never come out without the help of a knife, even the pan was sprayed. On the other side, I am very satisfied with the Kitchenaid product, becuase beautiful muffins come right out, when turn the pan unside down (need to apply cooking spray before baking). Yes, it did have some plastic smell during baking for the first couple times. After that, no smell at all. I chose not to pay $5 extra for the rack, still it works well with a cookie tray. The only negative comment is the unerasble marks left by grease(oil/cooking spray) on the surface. I am not complaining about it, as it states clearly in the instructions, and it does not affect baking. Overall, I am very satisfied with this product, and I will buy more for my new kitchen.
kitchen & housewares||5.0||Delighted to have it for my wood floors, tile and area rugs. Works great picking up cat fur and other organic and non-organic detritus that collects. Does require emptying the fur catcher and cleaning the brush regularly - gosh darn! So much easier to do that than taking a broom or dust mop to the entire house. Also have to set up the virtual walls and carry it upstairs and down, when I want to change areas being cleaned. Again, gosh darn! Can't totally eliminate ALL the work, no matter how much I might like to.Don't know what was wrong with it initially that it needed to be reconditioned, but its fine now
kitchen & housewares||5.0||I find this timer very easy to use. I'm not a rocket scientist.I have never been disappointed with Kitchen Aid. I don't understand why it has gotten bad reviews. I think some people should stick with a sun dial
kitchen & housewares||2.0||Had to return the first one because of a lock malfunction (it locked but would not unlock).  Amazon was great about responding immediately and replacing it promptly.  However, the lock on the second one does not work properly, either (it doesn't lock), though I will keep it, since keeping little hands safe is not an issue in my home. This item is a good way of storing blades and disks, but unless Cuisinart comes up with a more reliable locking mechanism, don't count on it to protect small hands from getting into it.

kitchen & housewares||5.0||Last holiday season, I received this Fiestaware Scarlet dinnerware set as a gift. I absolutely love these dishes. They are strong, look wonderful, and put a smile on my face every time I open my cupboard at mealtime. Not one dish has chipped or cracked and the color is even and vibrant. I find the size of each item comfortable to use. The fact that they are dishwasher and microwave safe is just another wonderful bonus. Now I am looking forward to adding more pieces to my collection. Buy this set! The quality and price can't be beat!!
kitchen & housewares||4.0||I dont think it was as bad as the reviews imply.  I've had mine about 6 months now and it still works fine, the only complaint I have is about the settings as one person said it can be the exact same on both sides and yet one side will "burn" and one be "underdone".  I just adjusted these and turned them so they both cook whatever I'm making right, even though it is off by one number compared to the other side.  So thats a fluke for sure which would make it worth buying one without any problems, but frankly I've yet to find such a toaster.  Other then that I've had no problems with this one, I love the look and style of it as well it is so cute and practical other then the above problem.  I would recommend this toaster but as I got it as a gift I probably wouldnt spend the $50 but would gladly pay $30 for it.  I dont think you can really find a better toaster I've done the cheap kmart specials and frankly those dont last as long as this has without much worse problems or burning.

The plastic housings are so lightweight I don't think it'd survive ordinary outdoor use either.  Certianly not a drop off your grill.  Felt like I had to handle it gingerly so I didn't crush it with my hands.  This one is going back -Sorry AZ.

kitchen & housewares||2.0||The tea press works fine if you are planning on serving a crowd.  For one or two people, it simply doesn't work.  You must add an enormous amount of tea for the press to work properly.  I once had a smaller tea press, and I thought that was what I was purchasing here.
kitchen & housewares||5.0||The feature's on this machine are what drew me to choose Krups Espresso Maker. The pump instead of the pressure machines was the first draw. The water tank and its size, not having to fill it every day. The fact that the frothing nozzle moved and the location of it. And nobody makes a frothier frother than Krups makes. I love the lattes and I use a large stainless steel milk steaming pitcher. You can make two cups at once. I use it daily and sometimes more than once a day! It makes a great espresso with beautiful crema. I have not had any problems with this machine.Clean after every use. I can't stress this enough and it only takes a minute to wipe the brew area. And do the internal cleaning with solution often or you will get the slow drips of espresso when brewing because of deposit build ups.  Follow cleaning instructions! I highly recommend this one! Enjoy

I was not very happy with this predicament at all
kitchen & housewares||1.0||I saw the 3-star reviews here, but decided to ignore them as this pan was on sale for a very good price.  That was a big mistake.1.  The first problem is with the size of the muffin cups -- they are significantly more shallow than in a typical mini-muffin pan.  2.  The silicone warped from the heat while in the oven, spilling the meager contents of the tiny cups over the edges, making flat, crooked, ugly muffins.3. The silicone did not release the muffins easily.  I did spray it with nonstick spray before filling, and allowed the muffins to cool completely before I tried to get them out.  I didn't even bother to try and wash it, so I don't have any comment about the ease of washing.  I won't be wasting any more time and ingredients in it, so I threw it away.  I wish I could get my money back.  This is not the quality you would expect from KitchenAid
kitchen & housewares||1.0||The rating I give this item relates to the lack of value.  In a few more clicks, you can buy a service-for-eight of white corelle for less than what three of these dinner plates will cost you. That said, I have owned my Corelle (two services-for-four) for more than twenty-five years, using it regularly.  All dishes are intact, they are light and stack nicely, and maybe I'm just not enough of a snob but I don't know why anyone would need any other dishes

kitchen & housewares||5.0||I can't begin to describe how worthwhile a piece of equipment this is.  It makes the best little potato shreds for potato pancakes, then, you just switch blades and slice up a little onion for them in the same bowl, which you can then mix the batter in.

kitchen & housewares||5.0||We've only used them once, so can't comment on longevity, but our initial use was great.  No odor or fumes as other people have reported.  Even though we forgot to spray it, the muffins came out clean and easy.  The tray is a definite plus!  We got two different Roshco silicon pans, and it does seem that baking times and temps may need to be slightly adjusted and is probably what let to some of the complaints people have listed
kitchen & housewares||5.0||This item was ordered to replace a Kitchen Aid unit used extensively for a number of years.  I am a heavy gourmet baker and cater to very discriminating clients.  I first heard of the DeLonghi Mixer when it was branded Kenwood -in an Australian magazine. What a nice difference!  The Kitchen Aid now appears to be so antiquated by comparison!!  I love the very practical easy to clean design and construction of the DeLonghi as well as the physical ability of the unit to mix more content in a more complete manner.I am very pleased with this purchase and would recommend this product.  
kitchen & housewares||5.0||I own many items from the Le Creuset stoneware collection, and I must say that they are all of superb quality.  This square pan  is perfect for baking and serving my favorite side dishes and desserts.  I have been impressed over and over again at how non-stick the surface of this bakeware is.  Everything I have put into Le Creuset bakeware - brownies, casseroles, refried beans, etc. - has come clean with zero elbow grease.  In fact, the dishwasher usually gets them sparkling clean without my help!  I highly recommend this product as well as everything else from this line

kitchen & housewares||1.0||I ordered the My Cafe from Amazon in early October and received it a few days later. On initial set-up, the unit failed to prime. I talked to Bunn's Service Dept. and was coached to try several steps, which did not work. I was given a return authorization number and told that I would be sent a brand new machine once they received the defective one. I have Fed Ex verification that the My Cafe was received by Bunn on October 18. I called Bunn on November 6 and was told that they would check on my replacement and call me back in a couple on minutes. No return call came. I called again on November 9th and was told that the My Cafe has been on back order and that I am in line with an unknown other number of customers awaiting shipment. They could not, or would not, give me any meaningful information on when I might expect to see if the replacement works any better than the original. My Cafe may be a great machine but Bunn's service is atrocious
kitchen & housewares||1.0||I had the unit for about 4 weeks before it broke completely. The rake would continually get clogged from the clumping litter, even with daily cleaning. Sometimes the unit would cycle on and off all night, very noisily, until I put a timer on it to turn off at night. It was very diffult to clean, even with daily inspection.Go the old fashioned way, with a tray and a liner

kitchen & housewares||5.0||this set of blender accessories was just what i needed to update my old blender.  seperatly these items become more costly but here they are at a great value and shopping is made easy because this set has it all 
kitchen & housewares||2.0||This blender is frustrating. It offers good points, but in the end, the flaws outweigh the benefits. First the good:The heavy glass base is stable and easy to clean. The powerful motor hacks through most foods with ease. When the blender is started, the motor begins at a low speed for a second or two before turning on fully.The problems I found led me to toss the blender. If you plan on making blended soups, beware of the explosive force with which this beast turns on. Without a heavy hand on the lid, both the lid and your soup will hit the ceiling. Moderately thick, viscous liquids (a lemon cream was the latest such one I experienced) tend to get caught in the scalloped swoops in the jar. This leads to only the center portion of the liquid being actively blended, while the outer edges stagnate and remain clumpy. Deft work with a spatula is required to coax everything into the blending area.The above problems were annoying, caused occasional swearing, but  were tolerable. What finally got me shopping for a replacement was worse. After several years of moderate use, the KitchenAid stopped working. The blades and motor are connected via a set of rubber teeth. These reduce operating noise, but over time, weaken. The problem first arose when making smoothies with chunky frozen fruit such as strawberries. A burning rubber smell came from the blender coupled with a strange noise and no action in the container. The rubber drive teeth slipped, and friction quickly heated them up. The result was hot, floppy rubber teeth that bent flat instead of turning the blades. When this happens, it takes 20 minutes or more before the teeth are capable of another round of use. Before long the blender could not even swirl water for more than a few seconds before the teeth slipped

kitchen & housewares||4.0||I pretty much agree with ILikeAmazon's review below.  This blender looks nice, sounds quiet and doesn't dance all over the kitchen when being used.  The lid stays put and it's easy to clean.  It also matches all my other small Kitchen Aid appliances.  Like others though, I make a smoothie every morning and I've had to learn how to use this blender for that.   First, it's helpful to let any frozen items sit for awhile in the blender (I load it as soon as I get water on for my coffee so it can sit until the last thing I do before leaving the house).  If pushed for time, then I've found that putting the blender on pulse and constantly pulsing until the contents agitate on their own helps.  The problem is that either the funnel shaped bottom and/or the blades being turned in several directions pushes the frozen mush above the funnel shaped bottom of the blender.  Air enters the funnel shaped bottom and the mush calmly just sits above the blades.  At this point, the blender can be stopped and the mush gently pushed back down into the funnel before restarting the blender.  Kitchen Aid products (and their customer service) are superior.  This blender is a nice addition to my kitchen.  As ILikeAmazon said:  "There are always tradeoffs."  I do hope however that they improve on the smoothie making capabilities of this powerful, attractive blender.  Then it will be a five star appliance.By the way:  I like Amazon too! 
kitchen & housewares||5.0||Love this cake plate. Looks like our retro 50s kitchen. Its solid, well-formed glass with fluting on the base, a nice touch. And you can't beat the price.

After approximately 6 months of satisfactory occasional use the juicer is no longer functional.  Some of the teeth on the gear that is connected to the press lever have broken off.  I had expected a product this simple would have lasted for years.  I am obviously totally disappointed

kitchen & housewares||2.0||Usually OXO produces well designed items that have you thinking "They *really* thought about how this thing was going to be used (and abused)!"  Unfortunately the other reviewers are spot on -- very bendy handles.  It's a shame, but you should pass on these
kitchen & housewares||1.0||Please note that I have several Henckel knives that I really like, so this is definitely not a anti-Henckel biased review.There is really only one problem with this knife - the blade is way too thick.  If there's only one problem - then why do I give it only one star?  Well, this one problem completely ruins this knife.  The 'eversharp' name I'm sure refers to the fact that the serrations are not the standard "wave pattern" you'd see on most bread knives. Instead, each serration has several smaller serrations and spikes built in. I know that this is supposed to ensure that the knife will never end up dull - but in the process it makes it horrible at doing any kind of delicate cutting. Plus, the blade is not flexible in any way due to the extreme thickness. Unless you are cutting the sturdiest bread out there, you'll crush it while trying to slice with this blade. Forget about cutting any kind of soft bread or pastry. I've found that some of our cheap steak knives work far better than this knife.I've come to the conclusion that this knife is horrible after comparing it to two other bread knives I now own. The first was a Paderno (small Canadian company) that we got for our wedding, and the second was a Global bought from Amazon. Both are considerably more expensive than this knife, but there are other, more economical options out there that are still far better. You want to find a nice, thin blade with even and sharp serrations. If you're looking to stay in this price range, you won't find anything forged - these will all be stamped or laser cut - but that's fine - the bread knife doesn't need to be strong like your chef's knife.Pros:-CheapCons:-Mashes your bread while it cuts-Hard to get started through crusts due to blade thickness-The 'spiky' serrations are dangerous to your fingers (think many tiny needles along the blade) - they tend to nick you easily - but they are useless for their intended purpose of cutting bread.Suggestion: Steer clear. If you can afford it, get a Global (or even a better Henckel). Otherwise, look for a the thin stamped blade
kitchen & housewares||4.0||I ordered all three colors of these mugs - red, blue and white.  The blue and white mugs have a shiny, even glaze.  The red glaze is mottled and has more of a matte finish, giving it a more rustic, country look.  The mugs are great but the three different colors look very different and really don't match each other. 
kitchen & housewares||5.0||This steamer fits perfectly on Cuisinart's 4 Qt saucepan.  The lid seals in every bit of steam.  I used to always have to add more water when steaming batches of corn-on-the-cob, but since no steam escapes here, I can make several batches non-stop.  I also like the fact that the steamer is wide; that means that the food will cook evenly (instead of other steamers where the stuff at the bottom gets overcooked and the stuff at the very top gets undercooked).  I've only used the steamer five or six times but so far, there's practically no sign of dullness or staining - maybe just a little sign of dullness, but I'm more interested in function than appearance.  Washing it immediately will keep it stain-free.  Overall, an incredible deal for $20.00

This works just as well I'm sure and such a cool color!  It's easy to find in a drawer or my "wooden spoon jug" where I keep all odd utensils.  It is a little light weight, but after going through carpal tunnel surgery, I don't think I need one much heavier. Fast shipping and great packaging as well.  Another great find from Amazon

kitchen & housewares||5.0||So far this has been a great product. I've had it for about a year and a half and have used it almost every day to hold boiling water for making tea.  So far it has held up great.  This carafe keeps the water near boiling for at least 5 hours. When I leave the water in it for 24 hours, the water is still warm enough for me to make tea with it.  I have never used this item to store anything else other than water; but in theory, you should be able to make tea or coffe the night before and still have it hot in the morning 6 to 8 hours later, assuming the liquid is boiling when you pour it in.  Some of the heat from the water is lost from the initial contact with the carafe, so the liquid you store will always be a little cooler than its intial temperature.

kitchen & housewares||5.0||All Coffee grinders leave a bit of a mess so don't let the comments about stray grinds deter you. All the reviewers who used flavored beans need to be discounted since that is not recommended.  Others seem to have trouble with the "door" which is really just a deflector for the grind. You get a few grinds on the counter but that is a small price to pay for delicious fresh coffee.Th A-9 has a strong relatively quiet motor (which means it is still loud, but not as loud as most other burr grinders0 and takes up very little counter space. The glass hopper for the beans seals at the top with a scrw on lid.I love the idea of the measuring cup which saves a lot of time scooping.It eliminates that step...just grind until you have the right amount and dump it into your coffee basket.Kitchen Aid has a nice Pro model that costs twice as much by why pay more for less

I bought two sets in different colors and mix and match which makes the eating experience even more fun. I want to start collecting all the fun serving pieces too.

I bought a second set to make sure I had plenty for when friends came over for dinner.  Speaking of friends over for dinner, on the two occasions that I have had friends over for dinner since I bought the set, people always compliment the pieces.  I am very happy with my purchase
kitchen & housewares||5.0||I was thinking about a way to make coffee at work where there was no coffee machine easily accessable. I thought a french press would be a great idea, but all of them seemed to be made of glass and I didn't want to leave my press laying around where I work (we share space with other companies so people come and go). With this mug all I have to do is heat up some hot water in the microwave and throw it in with the coffee or tea (and maybe some sugar). Wait a bit, push down the press and drink. The whole mug is well made out of metal and high quality plastic and rubber. The bottom stores a cannister which holds enough coffee or tea for another cup or two and the seal is tight enough to keep it fresh. I read another review of the mug somewhere and they complained about getting coffee grinds coming through. Well let me say this mug has a double filter, one on the plunger part of the press and one on the lid where you drink or pour from. Coffee used for french press preperation is supposed to be a coarse grind. I think that person tried using store bought ground coffee or just didn't know any better and put finely ground coffee in. The mug will do a pretty good job even with coffee like that, but some is bound to get through that way and you get a muddy cup besides the point so use coffee made for french press brewing not finely ground coffee and you will love this mug
kitchen & housewares||1.0||We're a small restaurant (16 seats), serving dinner 4 nights a week, and we use the blender for soups, Caesar dressing, etc., once or twice a week, but never use ice in it or anything like that. We've had two of this same model now, and had the same problem with both of them. The black collar, the part of the base where you set the container, is plastic, and on both blenders has broken. The first time it lasted almost a year, and we figured that wasn't too bad -- especially when you compare the cost to a true commercial/professional blender, which are $300+. Also, we really like the blender in terms of function, so we picked up another one. This time, the exact same thing happene, except that the collar cracked within 2 weeks!! My other complaint is that I found Waring Customer Service to be disinterested & unhelpful -- especially because I contacted them about buying a new model, not about problems with the one we had. I saw a model on their website but no purchasing info was listed; I emailed to find out where to purchase, and the rep seemed almost inconvenienced by my inquiry

Ten Months later this bottle stopped keeping anything warm and would feel warm to the touch after you poured warm liquids in it - evidence of the loss of its insulating function.  I think it lost the vacuum in the cavity which I think is the method used to insulate the liquid inside.  When you spend $25 one would think it's a good quality product - Think again

kitchen & housewares||5.0||I bought one of these muffin pans because I was excited at the prospect of owning a piece of bakeware whose lining wasn't destroyed by the 3rd time I wanted to use it. For that alone, I would give this item 5 stars.I am not an experienced baker, but I think that after reading the other review for this item that more balanced comments need to be stated regarding the actual use of this muffin pan.So here are my comments:1. You need to use a cookie sheet (or something similar) to support the pan since it is flexible.2. The muffins cook faster than with a metal pan.3. The muffins seem small if you fill the cups as you would with a metal muffin pan - you can actually fill them up all the way. (Recall that I am not an experienced baker; as an engineer I suspect that since the muffins cook differently, i.e. faster, this could be compensated by adjusting the batter in some manner. As far I'm concerned as long as the muffins taste good, it doesn't matter to me.)4. The coating is not exactly non-stick. You do not need to grease the pan, but you do need to be careful when it comes time to remove the muffins. I use the dull side of table knife to separate the muffin sides from the pan (while gently pulling the pan). After doing that I put a plate on top of the muffin pan and  hold it against the pan as I invert the pan. All I have to do then is tap the bottoms of the muffin cups to get them out. By my third time doing this I was able to get them all out intact and unscathed.I am very happy with my muffin pan - it might take a little bit of getting used to for someone used to other pans - but for me, the benefit of not having a cheap non-stick coating peeling off of the metal after a year more than compensates for a slight learning curve on the use

A replacement probe is $10-15 provided you can find one. It seems all these units have problems with the probes. Well, enough for me. I'll go back to my traditional thermometer
kitchen & housewares||5.0||I hav K5SS model of the Kitchen Aid Mixer and it has worked well for me when I do my cookies, cakes or mix ground meat for meat loaf. It is very easy and convenient to use. Basically, I would want to inquire about other attachments for this model and how and where can I get them. I am from the Philippines. I am interested to purchase attachements like a sausage stuffer, grinder. Sorry for using this site, as I am lost where to get in touch with "Kitchen Aid Inc". thanks and please email me
kitchen & housewares||5.0||I have had these pans for five years now and I use them almost every night.  I have never had any problems with them and they cook the food very evenly.  I would highly recommend them. 
kitchen & housewares||2.0||After a couple of years of casual use, my bowl also cracked in the freezer. Fortunately I had it wrapped in a plastic bag so the mess was kept to a minimum. Now I'm in the market for one with a higher quality bowl.
kitchen & housewares||1.0||I bought this pan as a Christmas gift for my husband.  It would have been easier if I had just put a match to my money and burned it.  He has given up using this pan.  He even read the directions thinking he was doing something wrong.  Every egg he placed in it stuck to the side of the teflon rings.  What a shame.  The only use would be to throw the rings away and just use it as a regular pan.  Don't waste your money

kitchen & housewares||1.0||Tired of exploring every possible way to ruin a pot of rice, I was looking forward to something that would do the job well and consistently.  No such luck with this one! First, it uses a different measuring system for the rice ("rice cooker cup")than it does for the water ("regular measuring cup"), so if you need more or less than the few amounts they list it's back to guesswork again! Worse though, is that the amount of water they call for is hugely more than is actually needed, so it boils very fast while pumping out all the excess water as steam. For those who might like to take a steam bath while they cook this would be great. One might figure out how to adjust the measuring, but there seems no way to slow the boiling down to lessen the steam output. Since water boils at the same temperature, fast or slow, it makes no sense.Yet another gripe is that it automatically goes into "warm" mode when it is finished. May be handy to have the warm option, but if you don't realize it's done and its left on "warm" for ten minutes the rice turns into a solid slab.It seems very well made, and handsome Bau-Haus design, but unfotrtunately I can't use it because of the above problems. Others' experience may vary. Keep in mind I'm very good at ruining rice. I just don't need help doing it!David
kitchen & housewares||5.0||I'm a single 47 year old guy.  I'm not a great cook.  I've lost 25# (am now down to 168) and am trying to eat better.  This makes it easy!  No more nuking junk food, or frying food covered in fat, just steam it.  No more worries about burning things (the smoke detector used to be my warning that dinner was done).  I bought the Oster 5712 last week.  I've cooked boiled eggs, frozen chicken breast, Contessa stir fry frozen oriental dinners and frozen fish in it so far.  It rocks!  Tonight I'm going to cook diced chicken breast and wild rice with seasonings in it and I'm 99.9% sure it will turn out great even though I've never tried it before.  This baby makes cooking easy.  Cleaning it is also easy.  No burnt food on it, just hot water.  For cleaning it's almost like is has already been soaking in hot dishwater.  Just a bit of soap and spray it off.  As far as price vs functionality this thing is a steal!  -  Jo
kitchen & housewares||5.0||Very nice, beats flimsy plastic. I have broken or otherwise worn out parts of plastic measuring sets. These will probably outlast me
kitchen & housewares||4.0||Kitchens Etc put price stickers on the outsides of each bowl.  These are not coming off easily at all. Each one of them has a sticky, white adhesive mess on the side. The bowls themselves are cute
kitchen & housewares||5.0||I carefully read most of the reviews for this product before purchasing so I would know what to expect.  They mostly said the same thing:  either it broke or it worked perfectly.  The consensus seemed to say use only hard cheeses, and don't overcrank the handle.  We have only used it for parmesan cheese, and so far we've had no problems.  It works great so far
kitchen & housewares||2.0||I was given this coffee maker for a birthday gift a couple of years ago and after I figured out how to make it work, loved it. After a while the latch on the top broke off and I had to hold the top down while it was grinding the coffee. That made the timer on it useless unless you propped something against it to hold the top down. It was a little inconvenient but I got use to it. Then the metal filter broke and I decided to get a new one. Luckily I put the old one in the garage for "spare parts" because not long after I started using the new one the side tab broke off and I had to grab a replacement off the old one. I will probably not purchase this brand again
kitchen & housewares||4.0||The pot rack came as advertised and it was a snap to put up.  It looks OK and works well with my wall space.  I would purchase this item again
kitchen & housewares||2.0||The interior of this pan got discolored after the very first use. It got yellow stains from cooking tomatoes in a little bit of oil. A lot of scrubbing and a cycle in the dishwasher lightened the stains, but the pan never got its new look back
kitchen & housewares||4.0||I love the function of these glasses.  We were given some of these Bodum double wall glasses and immediately saw the quality difference.  They will not sweat, they will keep your cold stuff cold, etc.  I have two down-sides...  These must be handled gently, they are not that thick or hearty.  Until we realized what was going on, we cracked two by having our refigerator ice dispensor throw cubes into them, cracking them.  Plus I yanked the dishwasher open fast, knocking one over into something solid, and it broke.  But overall, if you handle them with a bit of care, they are really neat glasses
kitchen & housewares||1.0||First of all I'm a Dyson fanatic....I have a total of three (one on each floor).  When we bought our cabin I couldn't stand to give one up and felt too cheap to buy another one (they are pricey) for carpet I'm on five or six times a year so I bought this.  At first I was thrilled.  It was wonderful.  After using it a few times however it has completely lost suction.  Keep in mind this is being used in a second home with no kids, pets or real dirt.  I would doubt that it's on except that it's noisy and takes off without me.  I have bought new filters and looked for blockages but nothing has worked.  Also the "dirt container" is sometimes hard to remove and put back.  Feels like it's catching on something.  What a waste of money.  Even in my college days I've never had a worse vacuum.  I highly recommend the Dyson instead or even the $50 Dirt Devil I gave my niece as a wedding present- it cleans circles around this thing.  To me "Hoover" spells "DISAPPOINMENT"
kitchen & housewares||1.0||I purchased a few of these for myself and friends. From the day I got my spoon spatula it was my favorite kitchen tool, especially since I could use it when making sauces or frying onions and veggies. One day when making a non-meat tomato sauce the handle simply broke off leaving the handle in my hand and the spatula in the pot. I wrote to OXO about this twice in the last 2 months with no reply and this is most frustrating to me. Anyway, I am now using a KitchenAid product which feels much more sturdy and KitchenAid responds to e-mails IMMEDIATELY
kitchen & housewares||1.0||I am very disappointed.  These flowers are worse than what you see at a grocery store.  I ended up paying more from another vendor and getting flowers that she liked.  I buy roses alot, and I know what a fair cost is for good quality.  If you're paying less than $30, beware
kitchen & housewares||5.0||There isn't much you say about a plasic cover, but I'll try...  These  covers fit securely over the bowl for kepting whatever you're mixing fresh.   You can also store anything in it like it was a tuperware (spelling?)  item.  I'd recomend having them around, because you'll use them!  These are  for the 4 1/2 quart bowl and are dishwasher safe

kitchen & housewares||1.0||I am a quilter and was looking for a good hot iron and lots of steam. I also hate the auto- shut off. Well I thought I had found it. The perfect iron for my needs. Well after only one days use it is put away for someone else to use I was very disapointed in the iron it spits water and boy do I mean spit my ironing board cover was wet. My fabric continued to to roll under the iron, the surface is not smooth and seems to grap the fabric. Not what I was looking for at all I would not recommend this iron
kitchen & housewares||1.0||These are substandard thin towels.  They are cheap.  The current price is far too much to pay, and they should be about a buck each.They are terrible in dealing with liquid because they are so thin.I find the pictures here deceptive...there is nothing here that you can't find in your grocery store cheaper.
kitchen & housewares||5.0||Great thing to own and very useful for cooking small quantity of foods. I use it a lot

kitchen & housewares||2.0||I have owned this breadman for one year.  I make between one and two loafs of bread per week.  Mostly whole wheat bread.  I purchased the 900S because my previous machine was a breadman and it performed well (8 years).Pros:It makes a good loaf of bread.Good selection of cycles.Loaf is easy to extract from the pan.Cons:The motor is not very powerful.  It lugs down when making whole wheat bread.After 7 months of operation the Teflon wore off the mixing paddle.At 11 months the bearing failed in the mixing pan.Overall I am disappointed in this bread machine and I could not recommend it
kitchen & housewares||5.0||These cup are enormous! (Not to mention beautiful, in that fun and elegant way that only Fiestaware can be.) I was looking for a very large, oversized mug because I drink a lot of coffee and tea and am sick of having to refill constantly. I definately got my wish. I have eaten soup and cereal out of these, I even used them to serve coffee ice cream recently. Very cute! I plan on getting them in all of the six colors I have in Fiestaware. Let me tell you again, this cup is HUGE
kitchen & housewares||4.0||I had tried a different ice cream maker that you had to freeze the bowl and returned it. It was too annoying to keep freezing the bowl and it took up too much space in my freezer. I love the cuisinaret Ice-50bc it makes great ice cream. The only negative is the noise and that's why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. It is extremely noisy so I pretty much have to leave the room when it's on. I do recommend the Ben and Jerry's ice cream book but wish they would revise it or do another one. See my review on it
kitchen & housewares||1.0||This unit was a great addition until the probe went bad after only a few months.  Not recommended
kitchen & housewares||2.0||It looked like a great Idea, just what I needed to get my older golden in and out of my jeep.  Problem is, there is a serious crush hazard because of the weight and design.  There is a finger "crush area" near the hinges where a user would most likely grasp the ramp to fold it. I have mashed fingers several times and sustained a moderately serious crushed finger the last time I used it.  If I can't make it safe with a saw, then out it goes.  It's too dangerous for anyone in my family to use
kitchen & housewares||5.0||Ok, cmon now.  It's a ladle and works well.  I own the extire oxo steel line and am pleased with all the products under this line.  They all perform their function well and with style.  And they are also very comfortable to use thanks to the famous oxo nonslip rubber handle/fins

kitchen & housewares||1.0||Disappointed with the size of product, have not used it yet
kitchen & housewares||1.0||Not much to say about this item it sucks. very thin and cheap made. Does not seal at all and does not keep the bread freah This is the worst product i have every got from Amazon.
kitchen & housewares||4.0||Twenty bucks for three name brand skillets is a great price.  They are not part of Farberware's higher end line (obviously from the price.  any educated consumer will recognize and admit this.)  The bottom line is that they do what they're supposed to do.  We are replacing a very heavy Revereware Non-stick pan my wife bought 1.5 years ago.  The teflon wa flaking off.  She had paid $45 for it.  we decided that most of the supermarket non-stick frying pans we've had over the years lasted 1-2 years and they were usually $13-20.  This Farberware set is a great value
kitchen & housewares||4.0||Its amazing how much dirt this little baby sucked off our couch and upholstry.  The ability to make the suction head vertical is quite helpful.  The vaccum cleaner is a bit on the heavy side though - if it had been a little lighter, I would have given it 5 stars
kitchen & housewares||5.0||I received this grinder as a Christmas gift from my son-in-law after my cheapo, cheapo grinder went kaput! I am surprised at some of the not so happy reviews because we use this grinder every single day, sometimes twice in one day, and it works really well. If the grinder is dedicated for coffee or spices, there's no need to clean it (like, with water and soap; just tap around the outside canister and all the excess residue falls off the edges into the cup/blade area. I really like the grinder, and knowing my luck, this Cuisinart will last a long time only because I've had my eye on a Kitchen Aid coffee grinder (to match the rest of my appliances) and just happened to get this one as a gift. Oh well! But, the grinder is worth the money, and it does what it's supposed to do. Unless you're the type of person who needs directions on how to breathe, this grinder is a no-brainer :-
kitchen & housewares||1.0||This is the worst blender I've ever used. Bought it to make smoothies, but it has a hard time grinding frozen things. It never completely chops up frozen fruit, so I always end up sucking down huge hunks of semi-mushy fruit when I try to blend with this thing. Not pleasant. It's also loud and it moves a lot. Sometimes it vibrates so hard the carafe detaches slightly from the base, and when you lift the carafe to pour your drink into a glass you find a fruity puddle in the base's well. I strongly discourage anyone from ever purchasing this horrible thing
kitchen & housewares||1.0||this item is priced wrong It is not in line with the other Calphalon item
kitchen & housewares||1.0||I purchased 5 of these dishes (at $9.99 each) to give as Christmas gifts.  Spode is manufactured in England, but the sub-standard knock-offs I received came from China. The color is dull and grayish. Return shipping would be outrageous, so I'm stuck with 5 ugly dishes.
kitchen & housewares||2.0||This Krups espresso maker leaves water and steam all over the counter every time it is used. I think the "built in safety" features are to blame. The finer the grind, the more water leaked out. Keep in mind that fine grinds are recommended for espresso and cappuccino.Using a coarse grind, which is usually only used for cowboy coffee out on the trail or French press machines, I still get quite a bit of leakage. Using finer grinds produces more and more leakage leaving only about half a carafe of extremely strong espresso which is indeed more like cowboy or french press coffees. -I enjoy cowboy coffee but would prefer espresso from my espresso machine plus I hate all the mess.The Krups machine I had fifteen years ago worked well but this machine sucks big time. If you don't want to fork over a lot of bucks for a "real" espresso maker, try a Mr Coffee espresso machine. Mine, which I use when I travel, cost less than twenty dollars and does not leak.In the meantime I have ordered a Lello 45900 Ariete Espresso/Cappuccino Maker to replace the Krups. -I'll keep you postsed.Billy Bat

kitchen & housewares||5.0||This is truely a professional grater.  Does a great job with hard cheeses and chocolate, etc..  Looks and feels great in the hand, and is impressive to have on the table for your dinner guests to grate their own Parmesan
kitchen & housewares||5.0||These are great beer mugs! I ordered 4 sets of them for myself and 2 for my brother. The first thing I noticed when I received them was that they were thick and HEAVY. The bottom isn't completely solid, but has space for a small pocket of air when it's sitting on the counter. It's inconsequential though, because the glass in these mugs is as thick as you would want any of your thick glass beer mugs. When I saw how nice they were, I actually went back online and bought 2 more and their margarita set which was also rediculously cheap ($15 for 6 glasses and a picher). I've been recomending these mugs to all my friends that drink
kitchen & housewares||2.0||The top portion of the freezer works great.  The bottom drawer portion sounded great - no more digging to see what's at the bottom.  The reality is that the bottom drawer is only useful as overflow from my refrigerator. I don't put anything in that part that I'm not willing to store at regular refrigerator temperatures.  It's a disappoinment

kitchen & housewares||5.0||I bought this knife sharpener because I was tired of knives that would not cut & the vender I brought it from, The Handy House, told me that it worked and I had bought things from her before on her word. And it works. My knifes are old & dull. A few swips through the sharpener blade & I had a brand new knife & the price is also good.
kitchen & housewares||5.0||I LOVE this set.  This was the first "real" cookware I've ever bought.  My husband and I did months of research before purchasing this set.  We've had it now for about 2 months and I can't express how much we've enjoyed it.  I've read several reviews that say food sticks and so on, but I think that perhaps those people think that because it looks similar to non stick, it is.  It's not!  Think of it like this:  It cooks like stainless steel and cleans up like non stick (maybe even better!).  We almost went with the All Clad, but we just couldn't get over how uncomfortable the handles were.  Since I haven't cooked with All Clad, I can't compare the Calphalon One to it, but I will say they heat evenly and cook evenly.  Clean up is SUPER easy!  Just this morning I made bacon and french toast.  I looked at the pans and thought "There is no way I'll ever get this clean!"  I poured some Bar Keeper's friend on it and went to work with my Scotch Brite pad and within MINUTES it was spotless!  Fantastic
kitchen & housewares||5.0||I have used this jigger several times a week since I got it back in November, and I think it's great.  I often make a second round with it.  It is difficult to remove the top with the jigger on, but otherwise it comes off fine as long as you open it up right after you make and pour a round of drinks
kitchen & housewares||1.0||I should have listened to the other reviewers, which I usually do. I followed the directions to the letter. Put it on in 95+ degree weather and never felt cool at all. In fact, after several minutes I actually felt hotter and was sweating as much as without this thing on. Even if it had worked, it was very uncomfortable. I am suprised that Sharper Image sells such a bad product
kitchen & housewares||2.0||We have a full line of Fiesta dishware and thought having the matching flatware would be nice. After a year of standard use and dishwashing, about 1/3 of the flatware is unusable. The upside is that it is cheap and replaceable. But count me among those who would rather pay more for something that lasts. We are in the process of ditching the Fiesta flatware line and moving to something more robust. PROS: Retro Stylish. Inexpensive compared to quality flatware.CONS: Very poorly made, Expensive if you need to replace 1/3 of flatware ever year
kitchen & housewares||2.0||True, these sheets do get rather wrinkled in the wash, however, that isn't my concern.......The description states that these sheets will fit a mattress up to 14 inches thick.  My pillowtop mattress is about 11 inches thick and these sheets don't fit!  I washed them in cold water and used the lowest dryer setting.  What a pain
kitchen & housewares||1.0||This product was horrible. I ordered a queen size and expected a huge box to arrive carrying such.  However, it was so small that a pair of shoes could have fit in it.  When I took the featherbed out of the box, it was terribly thin.  I currently have a featherbed and it is nice and fluffy.  This item unfortunately felt as though I was simply lying on a blanket.
kitchen & housewares||1.0||I bought this product hoping it would solve my problem with my barking terrier. He didn't even notice it was there. I put it near his crate and it still didn't stop him from barking.  I pushed the manual button and still nothing.  It promises to stop annoying barking, but it didn't stop my dog for one minute.  It was a complete waste of my money

kitchen & housewares||5.0||This kettle is very stylish with modern detailing.  The removable whistle and stay-cool handle are added pluses.  Its smooth lines make it very easy to clean, and its contemporary shape makes it especially attractive
kitchen & housewares||1.0||I found the following issues which put this purchase into the local landfill:1.) Once you get a successful potatoe to cut through, the ends of the fries are stuck in the thick grids.  Getting them out is a real pain, you need a lot of careful tugging and wiggling to remove them without breaking them.  Just a mess.2.) If you are slightly off 90 degrees when you start pushing through the potatoe, you are in a very dangerous zone.  Think of a lot of force applied to sharp blades that is going in the wrong direction.3.) Maybe my set was off tolerance, but the blade would not stay in the housing by itself.  I had to hold the blade in the housing and push it on the potatoe simulateously.  Not a big deal, but that for me sealed the 1-star rating.I guess the bottom line is, if you expect nothing out of it, you might use it, or if you are slicing something softer than potatoes.  For me, I've decided to get one of those Vollcraft units.  It's on order
kitchen & housewares||1.0||I decided to give this product a shot. Some reviewers said the bags would work properly if you don't overstuff them -- still not true! A Large bag re-inflated when I put 2 standard pillows in it. So I took out 1 pillow and tried again, and the bag was nowhere near being full. It seemed to work all right, but the next morning the pillow had re-inflated! And if you buy the bags with the zippers, the zippers come off easily, they make sealing more difficult, and one even tore a hole in the bag. I purchased straight from AsSeenOnTV.com, but their return policy looks a little weird. I'm not sure if I'll get a refund. Also be careful if you order straight from AsSeenOnTV.com -- I upgraded to express shipping and got my package 12 days later! I guess the product was just too good to be true.
kitchen & housewares||1.0||I have been making ice cream in a Cuisinart machine for years but I wanted to regain my freezer space from the 2 canisters I had to keep ready.. I also wanted to make good gelato since I can't go to Italy all the time. I had first bought the Lussino 4080 by Musso. It was terrible. Too soft right out of the machine and full of ice crystals when put in the freezer for any amount of time. It didn't get firm, it became a rock. I returned it and got the Lello Gelato Pro instead.  It is quieter, has a washable bowl, costs about half the money, weighs much less and makes 2 quarts rather than 1&1/2 quarts. There is no contest. The Lello is the superior machine

kitchen & housewares||2.0||I bought this and some other pans in the set.  Very disappointed.  I have a glass cooktop, and when the pans heat up, they warp. Then return to their normal shape when they cool down. Guess I got what I paid for
kitchen & housewares||2.0||I purchased this about 1 year ago and it's only taking up space in my house.  It has very poor suction on carpeting.  Works O.K. on hardwood floors but then again most of these will.  I expected better force.  The small openning may look "cool" but it doesn't allow for wide enough sweeping area and I find myself going over the same area again and again.  Also, the charging holder is a little harder to place the unit in.  I would consider look at others first
kitchen & housewares||1.0||I recently purchased this product.  The first time I used it, I thought it worked great.  I made a pot of chili and let it cook until we were ready to eat it that night.  The second time I used it, things were not as good.  The outer shell where the controls are were literally melting.  I had programmed this to cook for 10 hours while I went to work.  I came home that night and the hours had not changed. I realized I didn't click the on/off button to start heating the cooker.  This may have saved a house fire.  I went ahead and changed the time from 10 to 4 hours.  This set the unit to high instead of the original low setting.  Not 15 minutes after turning on, the outer covering was melting.  I immediately shut it off.  I see the 4 quart units were recalled back in 2004 for similar issues.  Whatever their problem, it has not been fixed.  Be aware of this serious problem when using your slow cooker.  I am returning mine and will exchange for a different brand
kitchen & housewares||5.0||These pans are mahvelous, dahling.  Having said that, I've read lots of reviews that included complaints about the strength of the adhesive used to stick the labels on the pans.  To one, to all:  There is a product called "GOO GONE" that is designed for just this type of thing.  You can find it almost anywhere, hardware stores, grocery stores, etc.  It works in minutes, and leaves no trace of the adhesive behind.  Just be sure the wash the pan afterwards.  Happy adhesive-free baking

Then I had problems with the stem.  When I tried to get a new one from customer service they told me that they were no longer servicing my older model and suggested I buy a new Cuisinart!  Stay away from Cuisinart!  I'm looking into Kitchen Aid for my new processor

So if you get the half pint size you will need to stock up on chargers.) I can't believe how long cream lasts in this thing. I had cream in it for almost two weeks and it was still fresh! The canned whip cream you buy in the store is too sweet for me, so I just put a little bit of Torino Caramel syrup in with the cream to flavor it. I use it when company comes over for coffee, pie, etc. Why didn't I buy one of these things sooner

kitchen & housewares||5.0||This is in my opinion the best waffle iron you can purchase for home use. There might be a better $600 waffle iron out there, but this is far and away and excellent product. Although I do feel that it's a little flimsy to be called a "professional" product, and seeing as how I've worked in the food industry my whole life, I feel validated in saying that. However, I have used it for a while now, and I have thoroughly enjoyed it. From soft to crisp waffles in a short amount of time, any easy to use and clean. My ony complaint is that it's rather large for the size of my kitchen. Excellent waffles! Thick and golden, like in the user submitted photos. I've never had waffles so good, not even in a restaurant. The true Belgian waffle recipes do take a bit of patience and know-how, but they're worth the effort. I read some complaints about the timing mechanism, but I find it to be spot on for the most part. Its worth the money

What a great price! I was so excited and waiting on the door on the schedule delivery day. The packing is nice and secure. The color was so vivid at the first sight, but.... after I took a hard look, almost half of the bowls are defective!! Un-colored white spot, un-glazed bubble holes, black dots/stain inside of the bowl. Even defective spots are tiny, but they are so obvious. They just don't look good with those flaws on them! I was so....disappointed and frustrated as I went through all the 21 bowls I ordered. By the way, the BLACK bowl have no name or mark of the manufacturer on the bottom of the bowl. I will say those are probably the factory-secondary products. It turned out I have to return almost half of the bowls and keep those bowls with bearable defectiveness, such as vague stamp of the manufacturer on the bottom of the bowls. Of course, all the black ones are returned since they are no-name with the bad quality. No one will even believe they are Fiestaware!!
kitchen & housewares||2.0||The 17 piece set is a great value but quality of the stainless steel is poor. The mirror finish doesn't last long when you begin cooking on or even boiling water. The bond use to stick the bottom plate to the bottom of the pan is odd. When 1st heated it makes a few popping sounds. I didn't expect a great quailty product due to the cost of the set. Finding everything that I needed and used was more important. The set does heat evenly and cook well it's just overall spotting and stains are an eye sore. This product is great if looking for style and going to hand it up over an Islan

The new model has a clock (not very useful), a stop watch function (moderately useful) and a triple timer function (fairly useful). Unfortunately the timer functions are more difficult to set than on the older unit. The alarm is very weak, very difficult for me to hear. I am looking for another alarm.

I was going to buy a new one - thank goodness I read the reviews first!  And yes, I did follow instructions - I baked my lasagne at 350 degrees, did not use an open flame or broiler, etc etc.  I can't believe this safety hazard is still allowed to be sold!  I am so mad!  I am switching to Corningware now

kitchen & housewares||5.0||With the advent of fancy featured coffee makers this is the right coffee maker for us.  We like to brew 1 large mug of coffee at a time so we have fresh tasting coffee.  Most models now have a carafe with the stop brew feature so you can pour out a cup while it is brewing.    But you must use their carafe.  With this maker you can use your own mug.  And if the carafe breaks (and it costs as much as the maker to replace sometimes) you can still use the maker with the mug or other container.  I sometimes use a stainless steel pitcher.  Sure this maker isn't fancy, but I just want a simple cup of coffee and this maker does it with an appliance that doesn't take up lots of counter space.  I haven't had any problems with messes or clean up with this maker
kitchen & housewares||1.0||Well Im the newest victim of exploding pyrex.  Last night I was cooking some salmon in my 3-quart pyrex that I've had for 3 years and used many times before.  It was in my oven at 400 for only 25 minutes.  I pulled it out and set it on the counter.  Well I leaned in to check the salmon and as I pulled away the glass exploded! Not just broke but a full on explosion of glass flying everywhere.  Thankfully I pulled away when I did because if I had pulled away 2 seconds later I would have had a face full of Pyrex shrapnel. I came away with only a few small cuts on my stomach...and from what I've heard I was lucky.  Even though my boyfriend and I swept and vacumed our kitchen last night there was so much glass that in the morning light I could still see little pieces of glass all over the kitchen.  Im not taking any chances, Im throwing out my other Pyrex dishes and switching to all aluminum trays.  Please DO NOT USE PYREX! It is not worth the risk! You may have a few years of good use, but is it worth risking your safety or that of your children?Edit- I would just like to comment that I was using the dish within the guidelines. The oven was 400 and the dish was only in there for 25 minutes.  The kitchen was rather warm and the surface I set it on was not hot but definately not cool...so there was no drastic temperature change.  There were no scratches or cuts any where on the tray so I do not feel that the explosion was in anyway my fault. This explosion was purely the result of a poorly manufactured item

kitchen & housewares||1.0||Like the other reviewers, I followed the instructions for this machine to the letter.  I froze the canister in my deep-freeze for several days and took it out just in time to load it.  Although the recipe provided was quite tasty, even after 60 minutes the stuff never even got cold enough to reach the slush stage, let alone ice cream.  My kids pretty much drank it from the bowl.  It's advertised to make ice cream in 20 minutes; no way.  Returned it the next day (and paid for shipping)

They are a little bit stiff, and they don't seem to be softening up too much as time goes on.  I expected them to be a ton softer.  They are really good sheets, however, and I would buy them again
kitchen & housewares||4.0||Hi,We got this set one month after getting married, and guess what, it is the thing that we always wanted. It gives us the choices in pan sizes. and there are three more mixing bowls which come handy while cooking or storing left overs. The stockpots are wonderful, they are the used  most of the times. The mirror polish is still intact, I think this is a wonderful thing that a newly wed should  have. Its worth the price.Positive points: Food doesn't stick to the pots/pansYou get varieties of sizes.Easy to clean.Looks smart.Negative points: I feel the handles are little delicate, so we have to give support if the stockpot is completely filled The mixing bowls are quite thin. Be careful while dumping it into sin
kitchen & housewares||5.0||This is simply the best pan I own. *IF* you follow the directions on how to cook with this pot, you won't have a problem with sticking. It's easy to use, easy to clean, works for just about everything (except maybe making pancakes - for which you would want a non-stick griddle). I just love being able to use metal utensils with this pot and not having to worry about scratching it. LOVE it
kitchen & housewares||1.0||I chose this set of knives because of the Calphalon name (I love my cookware!), German steel use, and the description, "Hygienic fiberglass-reinforced poly resin handle will not absorb moisture, crack, split, or chip."  I was disappointed to find that one of the sets I ordered was already showing signs of rust -- even though the set was unused and delivered in a "sealed" box, all four handles had rust marks
kitchen & housewares||5.0||I used one of these when I was a teenager working in a pizza joint to scrape dough balls off the pan so I could spin pizza's.  Until recently I never knew how versitile these things are.I use it constantly to keep my cutting board clean, scape rememants of one item off before chopping the next, I use the side to smash garlic cloves, use the rounded handle to smooth surfaces, and more.  This thing is versatile, not just for baking.For the cheap price of this thing, no kitchen should be without
kitchen & housewares||1.0||This sushi set is really nice. Unfortunately Amazon doesn't know how to ship ceramic properly.In my original order, they sent it in a medium-sized box, with air cushions only on one side. Of course several of the pieces were shattered. So I requested a replacement via the returns website. The second order was dispatched immediately and sent via next-day. That was impressive. What was not impressive was that this time it was sent in an even *smaller* box, packed so tightly that the air cushions had burst. Naturally this set was also shattered.Fortunately, I hadn't yet returned the first order, so I was able to cannibalize some good pieces from the first set to complete the second. I'm sure their returns department won't like hearing that, but as I see it I've saved them the cost of a refund.Needless to say I won't be ordering ceramic flatware from Amazon again.Once again, I like the style of the set itself, and think it's a great deal for the price. I just recommend that you buy it somewhere else.
kitchen & housewares||1.0||I baked two batches of madelines side by side, one in this pan (set on a baking sheet), and another in a traditional pan with non-stick coating. I brushed both pans with canola oil before using. As per the package instructions, I allowed the madelines in the silicon pan to cool completely before removing them. The madelines in the traditional pan released easily, were golden and high, and had a pronounced design. The other batch were almost soggy (probably from cooling in the pan), flat, pale, and did not have the appearance of a madeline. To make matters worse, they did not release easily, and a few of them even broke as I attempted to remove them. I would not recommend this pan

kitchen & housewares||5.0||I love having the edge measurements as well as the circular measurments.  I wish I had a cabinet big enough for this wonder tool, but like some of my favorite baking sheets, this will have to live on top of the counter.

kitchen & housewares||5.0||I totally love this pan!I bake cakes all the time using this and other Hoffritz pans and they are absolutely wonderful. I was first impressed by the weight of the pan, the non-stick sufrace, and the even heat distribution. I noticed a remarkable difference in the quality of my cakes from the very first time I used the pan. Not only do my cakes look and taste great, I never have to worry about my cakes getting stuck to the pan or being lopsided.I'll never buy a cheap pan again. It's really is worth the extra couple of dollars. I doubt I'll ever have to replace any of the pans I've bought from them. I also purchased the Hoffritz springform pans and 9" rounds, same great results

After reading and making several sucessful batches using store bought yogurt for the starter, I tried another batch using the Rolmex starter purchased at the same time as the original failed starter.  The results were the same:  no thickening, just liquid.  Others seem to have had good results so it is possible that the culture I received was not properly stored at some point before I received it or that it was just a bum lot

It's pretty handy for hamburgers and also makes good panini sandwiches.  I haven't tried some of the other recipes so I can't really comment on anything else.  It is easy to clean, so that's a plus

I'm not telling anyone to buy or not buy this product but just be aware that you may have a problem.  I now need to buy a whole separate gasket which maybe costs all of $1.50 and will pay shipping of probably $3. 
kitchen & housewares||5.0||I love to cook, and own several different brands of cookware, All Clad, Cuisinart, and Calaphone.  This sauce pan didn't disappoint me.  I love it!!  The pan has a wider bottom than most 2 or 2 1/2 quart pans.  This is great if you need to saute onions or peppers at the beginning of a sauce, or if you need a little extra room to stir something.  I am very, very happy with this

I have used a Vacuvin for many years and it is a far superior product at a far lower cost.  We bought this item because it appeared to be easier to pump than the Vacuvin -- and it is.  The reason:  it doesn't preserve the wine.  I am seeking a return and refund, either through Amazon or Metrokane

I adore their gadgets and utencils...and then I came across this egg slicer.A good egg slicer is hard to find, and to find one matching my set..needless to say I was excited. But the first time I tried it, the wires simply popped out. It takes very little pressure to slice a hardboiled egg, but this poor slicer couldn't take itI am very surprised, considering the high quality of the other products that I own. I am on a hunt for another red egg slicer

kitchen & housewares||1.0||I am very disappointed with this product.  I was carving my Thanksgiving turkey yesterday when the knife stopped working after it got hooked on bone in the wing.  The motor continued to work, but the blades stopped moving.  The knife has only been used 3 times, but I had to throw it out today.  I opened the plastic case, and found a metal worm gear coming off the motor shaft,and a cheap nylon gear attached to it to move the blades back and forth.  The nylon gear was stripped and the knife was useless. My prior knife, much less expensive, lasted for 18 years.  The Cuisinart knife is not well made and only works well when it is not under any stress.

On two occasions the machine stopped dripping coffee in the pot, casing grounds to overflow the filter. I can only assume the pot was not perfectly placed. I searched for a red coffee maker at a resonable price but could find none without this type of pause and pour. I may have to remove button for 100% satisfaction. But I love the red accents in my kitchen

It was bigger than we wanted but we had no other choices.  WHAT A MISTAKE!!!!  After less than one year and not heavy use the connector to the thermostat (spade conn.) just fell apart.  Being the handy man that I am, I fixed it.  Today (9/6/2005) it burned out again.  This grill is a fire hazard and should be recalled.  It is a piece of junk.  We will replace it with a different brand.  Thanks for nothing George
kitchen & housewares||2.0||I loved the way the Vortex Digital Heater heated and the way it kept cool to the touch.  But within a week, the one I had started cutting off when it hit the set temperature and did not come back on.  I was worried that it was overheating all the time and called Vortex who told me I could send it in at my expense and pay $15 to fix it.  I emailed my Amazon seller (Louise at Pinnacle Packaging) who was wonderful and paid to have it sent back to her, and is going to refund my money.  I think I am going to buy another one only I am going to purchase it from a local store and make sure I can bring it back if the new one does the same thing.  I guess I am a sucker but I really liked the way the thing worked when it worked correctly
kitchen & housewares||2.0||The FS150 food slicer is fine for very light duty work such as cheese or lunch meats providing you don't push this unit too hard or use it too frequently. Ours lasted a year and a half of very occasional use before it burned out. The two biggest drawbacks are the sliding rail and the motor/gear train. First the slider is simply a  cheap plastic bushing on a metal rod that tends to bind up fairly quickly. We found that a little olive oil wiped on to the rod kept things moving well enough but it needs to be treated every time you use the slicer and then cleaned afterwards. Food grade Teflon or silicone spray did not seem to work as well as the olive oil.The big problem with this unit is the motor/gear train that drives the slicing wheel. The drive gear is plastic and will not tolerate any kind of continuous load and will strip out fairly easily if pushed too hard. We smoked the motor and stripped the gears just slicing up a couple of small roasts and we were not working the unit that hard. It does a decent job for the person that just wants to slice up a small bunch of deli foods for a party or do a weeks worth of cheese for the kids lunches but honestly a good knife will do just as well and not set you back ten minutes for cleaning every time you use it.If you are looking for a slicer to do more serious work you will have to spend the money and get something in the $400+ range. What this slicer is good for the deli counter can do for you for free when you buy your bologna. 
kitchen & housewares||1.0||We purchased the Cuisinart SmartPower blender for smoothies and light duty blending duties.  It's a nicely designed unit , very stable on the countertop, but very poor quality gear drive.  After a couple dozen uses, the motor gear wheel broke, apparently a common problem on these Cuisinarts, as noted by other reviewers.  Cuisinart customer service is worthless - it costs more to ship and repair the unit than to replace it.Replaced the worthless Cuisinart with a Kitchenaid.  Would recommend avoiding Cuisinart blenders due to this gear design flaw
kitchen & housewares||5.0||The first time I used it I put a little white vinegar into the water with the eggs and timer. It seemed to cut down on the plastic smell. Also the vinegar will seal your eggs if they crack preventing the insides from leaking out.

kitchen & housewares||5.0||Have to say "ditto" to all the reviewers below--I owned another brand before but it wasn't nearly as powerful.  At least one reviewer expresses concern about keeping the blades clean, so I must note that the instructions indicate everything but the motor housing--which detaches from the blade element--can go in the dishwasher!
kitchen & housewares||2.0||Maybe I just have stains that are too much for it, but this cleaner didn't seem to do very much, certainly not enough to warrant paying the extra for it versus normal cleaners.

kitchen & housewares||2.0||My husband bought this machine because it was supposed to be fast and convenient, and with different schedules, easier to brew one cup at a time. It worked fine at first, but now after just 3 weeks it leaks hot water all over the counter. This has happened to both my husband and me so it's not bad technique on our parts. We follow directions exactly, but we keep having to stop it, open the lid, check the pods, reclose the lid and try again. This takes all the convenience out of it especially when you have to clean coffe puddles off your counter. This just isn't acceptable, but it's mostly plastic so probably to be expected. We have used other pods besides the Senseo pods (which don't produce good coffee) but that shouldn't be an issue as they're all the same size. Anyway, we're trashing it and have ordered the Bunn professional which will hopefully do a much better job. I'll let you know in a future review. My advice on this one is either don't buy it or if you do, based on other positive reviews, keep the box and the receipt so you can return it when it starts malfunctioning

kitchen & housewares||1.0||I purchased this egg cooker specifically for poaching 2 eggs. I used large, farm-fresh eggs. Whatever combination of water and timing I tried, I never got a perfectly cooked poached egg. The Cuisinart instruction book is confusing in its layout - specifically page 5. I called Cuisinart and after much back and forth, it was determined the eggs I used were too large and the directions were for MEDIUM-sized eggs. If considering this machine, be aware you might have to sacrifice the eggs you want to eat.

She likes the view it gives her and it's room and she doesn't paw at the sides.  My larger Golden (118 lbs - and no he's not fat; he's just a tall, tall Golden) would paw at the sides and that could spell disaster with this crate.  She thinks is very cool and I like the weight of it for being prepared to hit the road when the next hurricane is announced.  He has a big folding metal crate and that suits him
kitchen & housewares||5.0||This is a very nice set of small measuring spoons-- excellent for measuring baking soda, salt, etc for recipes. They are very sturdy and much better than the inexpensive plastic products you find at the discount stores.

I really like this set and would recommend this to everyone

kitchen & housewares||1.0||I purchased the Robinson Pyrex Candy Thermometer as a replacement for my old, cheap tube thermometer that was giving off readings.My experience was that the probe failed to register temperatures above 100 degrees celcius.  It would get there and just freeze.  Additionally, the design of the thermometer makes it difficult to read exactly where your temperature is.  This makes it unsuitable for most candy-making where the difference of a degree or so could be critical.  The physical design of the thermometer feels very sturdy and is a nice stainless.  It is rather deceptive since you think you may be purchasing a higher quality tool than you are actually buying.  All said and done, after you replace the sugar, flavorings, creams and other ingredients from your spoiled batches of candy...and pay for the gas to run these errands ...the cost of using Robinson's Pyrex Candy Thermometer goes way up.Use a cup of ice water.  Or a more reliable brand of candy thermometer.  It's much better to shell out the extra dollars and get beautiful consistent results
kitchen & housewares||1.0||I have had this pan for a year. I bought it because it was on sale and was shopping around for a new pot set. I figured it would be a good test run on the Circulon brand. It grills great,but you will spend  twice the cooking time cleaning the pan! I could not imagine how much food would be left on this pan if someone without great eyesight cleaned it. You have to go along each crevice on both sides of the grill gooves to get the food out. It is very time consuming and tedious and just not worth it. I wonder if the Calphalon pan is the same??? As far as the pot set I ended up buying-Analon Titanium 12 piece. Highly reccomend it

It goes from the cooktop to serving in a contemporary fashion...WITHOUT spilling, breaking like some of the el-cheapo brands.  If you care for this spoon - it will serve you well for many years.  My first one - I used to death and it died only as a result of an accident with (in?) the blender.  Been searching for one ever since to replace - and at this price I am buying several
kitchen & housewares||1.0||I bought this vacuum new and used it three times. For those three times, it worked like a dream. Never had the carpet been so clean. It even looked like a professional carpet cleaner had just visited. On the fourth use, the brush abruptly stopped rolling and the motor started smoking. It cost me over $100 to repair. Beware buying this vacuum; repair shop owners will laugh when you bring it in because they see so many of them with broken belts and motors. Ignore what consumer reports says on this one and most definitley do not throw your money away on this piece of junk
kitchen & housewares||1.0||When I bought this item I attempted to test it in hot water. My only comparison was another grocery store thermometer which wasn't accurate.  It appeared to register better than the grocery store model.  However, when using it to make chocolate fudge, by the time it registered 225 degree's, the fudge was thickening in the pan, not a pretty sight.  I used it correctly and it has been stored according to manufacturers direction.  It has a 5 year Limited Warranty for replacement.  I don't feel it's worth the trouble to send back as I don't want another of this brands products, ever.  It's going in the garbage as I attempt to find an accurate, well calibrated candy thermometer
kitchen & housewares||5.0||This is a great little machine for college students and people with apartments.  Though I wouldn't recomend it for a family (get a bigger version), it was perfect for me and it's quick and easy.  A great buy and very much exceeded my expectations.  I love it
kitchen & housewares||1.0||Love those Irobot products and everything they're capable of doing.  In fact, this was my third purchase, but my first remanufactured product.  What a headache!  The product worked correctly just three times, then died. Both technical support and customer service from Irobot were helpful and prompt, but still took weeks to resolve the issues. I tried a different way of recharging, which didn't work.  Then they replaced the battery, but that still didn't solve the problem.  Ultimately I had to send the product back, then waited more than a month for a replacement, which was on backorder.  Finally, they substituted a different model, and which works just as advertised.  I'd never buy another remanufactured model.  But I still believe in Irobot.
kitchen & housewares||4.0||I got one of these as a x-mas gift a few years ago and love it!  It is especially wonderful around the holidays.  I like to make pies and it is great topping on all types of pies.  We also drink a lot of flavored coffee and hot chocolate in the winter (its pretty cold here at night) and love to top it off with the cream.  I'm not sure about the flavored syrups, but I just add some flavored coffee creamer (international delight or coffee mate) to the container and it makes it taste so good.  It is such a hit at holiday parties that I have to borrow my mom's to keep up with the demand.  It makes a great gift just be sure to get enough off the cartriage containers or you will run out
kitchen & housewares||2.0||I bought these towels to wash my car, so I wanted a thick soft 100% cotton nap.  What I received was on par with the thin towels you'd find at cheap hotel - not thick or soft.  On the plus side, the sewed in tag did say 100% cotton and it was made in the USA
kitchen & housewares||5.0||Le Creuset's grills, woks, and frying pans come with a textured black enamel that needs to be "Seasoned" like tradiitonal cast iron. There are instructions in the product pamphlet as to how to do this. Basically after removing the stickers using a warm water and soap soak and drying the pan, the pan is coated with a thin layer of vegetable oil with a paper towel and heated at medium heat until the oil smokes. Let the pan cool, remove the oil with a paper towel, and repeat two or three times. A surface "patina" builds up that is quite non-stick. From now on the pan can be cleaned with a moist towel. In the case of burned-on food, a brief soak in soapy water works well. As the pan is used the patina continues to build.  Le Creuset's omelete pans do come with silverstone non-stick if you like non-stick.  The textured enamel works well and is stable at higher heats than non-stick coating.  I own a Le Creuset Wok, a square grill pan, and three frying pans with this textured finish and I find that they work fine after being seasoned this way. I also own a Le Creuset Omlete pan that has a good non-stick coating. This pan work fine for delicate foods like egg and pancake preparations. The textured finish pans work well for grilling meats, stir fries, and other hardier preparations.  If you use good non-scratch silicone or nylon tools in your Le Creuset wares and a small amout of PAM or a little oil spread with a paper towel you will have no problems.
kitchen & housewares||4.0||Purchased these to go with a 7 inch Henckels International santoku that I've been using for years, and the phrase that comes to mind to describe all Fine Edge cutlery is "good enough."  No, it isn't restaurant quality, and yes, if you put these through the dishwasher they'll tarnish and probably even start to rust (any metal designated as "stainless" is rust resistant rather than rust proof, and reviewers of other Henckels products complaining about rust and tarnish probably aren't treating their knives very well).  As a graduate student on a budget who enjoys cooking, but doesn't always have the time for it, these knives are an ideal compromise between price and quality.  Be aware that they will occasionally require sharpening - I've had the santoku for almost three years and run it through a commercially available ceramic disk sharpener every few months and it still cuts very nicely - and should probably be hand-washed for longest life.  With that little bit of maintenance, however, this three piece set can meet nearly all of your cooking needs (it meets all of mine, but then I don't often dress poultry, filet my own fish, or do much that would require a cleaver or really subtle boning knife) for quite a nice price
kitchen & housewares||1.0||This product is junk.  I like most oxo products but this one is poorly designed.  The hadle is spot welded and can not hold any weight.  My second one broke after shaking the remains of a stock out.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!
kitchen & housewares||2.0||I bought this pan because it was non-stick, plus it had the air cushion between the layer of steel.  I bake my usual brownies and cookies and they all stuck to the pan.  It stuck more than my glass pyrex casserole pans.  It was not easy to get it off, I had to scrape it off and it took time and a bit of muscle.  Definitely not non-stick.  The air cusion works from preventing the bottom of the cookies from overbrowning, which is not exactly a great idea since the top of the cookie become significantly more brown than the bottom of the cookie, which sometimes is moist and not quite holding the cookie together.On the up side, this pan doesn't warp if you are baking at 350 degrees of below.  I am returning this item, I wanted non-stick and this definitel was not.

kitchen & housewares||5.0||I've had lots of coffemakers over the years, and always had a problem pouring the coffee into a cup. It ran over the side and made a mess, unless you poured it very slowly. I saw this model a few years ago and decided to try it. It is great. I will never own anything else. I have been looking for one to replace my old one, only because the heating element is dirty/rusty looking (my wife doesn't like it). In fact I'm going to buy one right now on Amazon, as I've looked at a few stores and the new Black and Decker models I have seen,don't have the dripless pouring spout

kitchen & housewares||1.0||Stainless-steel and die-cast aluminum construction promises performance, but the undersized electric motor limits this slicer to very light intermittent household use. The Waring FS800 Pro Electric Food Slicer seems to have a barely adequate motor when brand new with a new sharp blade. Just think how it will perform when the blade gets a little dull. This is definitely not a professional quality food slicer, it is only a light intermittent duty slicer at best
kitchen & housewares||1.0||I was happy with the performance of the strainer...easy to clean, fit well over the edges of pans, etc. But only a month after I received it, the handle snapped right off. I was draining a can of vegetables, so it doesn't seem to me that was overdoing it. I'll definitely check the fastenings on the next strainer I buy
kitchen & housewares||1.0||The design is ok. Nothing fancy, nothing different, it looks just like any other teakettle. It works fine. The handle doesn't get hot, and the whistle isn't too loud. I gave it one star because of the black goo that came inside. I washed it before using it, and after the water was done boiling, I saw little black particles floating in the water and the water smelled weird. The smell may have been caused by that black stuff. I washed the pot again and saw more black stuff coming out. I took one piece and noticed it was gooey. I checked if there was something that had melted when I boiled the water, but I saw the kettle was intact. I boiled more water and again I saw the black goo floating in the water. I have boiled water 7 times and have washed the pot 4 times, and there is still goo floating in the water, they are almost unnoticeable, like very tiny dots, but they are there. At least the funny smell is gone. I don't know what that black goo is or what's causing it or where it's coming from. I'm afraid it may contain dangerous metals or chemicals that can be harmful. If I keep seeing black goo, I'm sending it back. I think I've learned my lesson. When it comes to buying cookware, it's better to buy good quality. It's not worth jeopardizing your health to save a few bucks.Update: After washing it two more times and boiling water one more time I got rid of the goo. And I've noticed that the handle gets very hot when I fill it all the way up
kitchen & housewares||4.0||This is a decent unit.  For those who don't take the time to read or can't understand what they read the product listing states the scoop included is for a 4 ounce cup(4 x 4 is 16).  The usual sold in the US coffeemaker is a 4-6 ounces per cup capacity.  Coffee instructions say usually measures are for a 6 ounce cup.  A cup is not what you use or the standard liquid 8 ounce cup.  Most advertised 10 and 12 cup coffeemakers hold the same total amount in the carafe. The manufacturer calcultaes what will sell.  This has been going on since I bought my first coffeemaker 30 years ago. Caveat emptor!

After one run through the dishwasher, several pieces are rusted, the finish has worn off, and they are even pock-marked in places! I too threw away the box when I first took them out, and cannot find *any* information on warranty or how to contact Cambridge Silversmiths.    I've bought cheap individual pieces of stainless for *camping* that stood up better than this. I wish I'd put Oneida on my registry instead of this crap

kitchen & housewares||2.0||My first Cuisinart 4-slice toaster developed a dangerous problem after the 3-month warantee period: it started heating when not turned on, and made strange clicking sounds.  It never had toasted very well, and only toasted lightly on the darkest setting.  To their great credit, Cuisinart replaced the toaster for the shipping cost alone (although it took 3 months). The replacement toaster also toasts very lightly, very slowly, but at least it's not an immediate fire hazard
kitchen & housewares||4.0||We needed a small countertop dishwasher for our rec room, and after a few months of use, I can say this one is working out very well.It shipped quickly, with no damage (the box was pretty tattered, but the packing material and the actual dishwasher were fine). It's large for a countertop device, certainly bigger than most microwaves. Be sure to measure your available space, especially clearance to any cabinets above your installation site.I hit some minor bumps getting it installed. The dishwasher hose nozzle is supposed to connect to your kitchen faucet using a threaded  quick-connect coupler included in the box. The coupler is supposed to screw onto the end of the faucet, but the faucet on that sink was a removeable spray handle on a long hose. There's no way for the included adapter to hook up to this, so I wound up having to install a new faucet (this isn't as bad as it sounds, as we were planning to replace the old one anyway).I brought the quick connect adapter to the hardware store with me to be sure it would fit the threads on the new faucet. Everything seemed okay in the store, but when I got home and installed the new faucet, I had some trouble. It turns out that the included adapter isn't particularly good quality, and didn't fit the faucet threads tightly enough to stay in place once the water pressure was actually turned on.I blew the hose nozzle off the end of the new faucet a couple of times until I finally went back to the hardware store and picked up an off-the-shelf adapter. Fortunately, it looks like Danby is using all standard-sized parts, so I was able to replace the flaky adapter with a new one that works well for only a couple of dollars.Once I had the thing up and running, it was easy to load and use. The basket is built to hold four full place settings, but I find that with some creative jiggering I can get it to take in any odd collection of dishes, mugs, baby cups, storage containers and what have you. The basket insert is removeable, converting it to an all-glasses tray, which we found useful for party cleanup.The machine really heats the water, so dishes come out clean. Even sticky stuff like melted cheese usually cleans right up. I've never had to use the heat-boost "sanitize" setting.It uses a very small amount of dishwasher soap and rinse fluid, and you want to be careful NOT to add too much. I made the mistake of overfilling the soap holder (spilled a little too much, figured it would just rinse out, oops) and wound up flooding my countertop in suds. This has only happened once and there was no damage. Call it a learning experience.I saw in some of the other reviews that the timer knob occasionally won't advance when you start running the machine, and this did happen to me once as well after I'd had it for about two weeks. It hasn't recurred since then, either becuase I've been particularly careful to set the timer in the right start position, or the timer's "wearing in."Been using it steadily several times a week for a few months now, and after the initial hiccups, it's been working fine. No complaints, and now I'm looking for a Danby under-counter mini-refigerator to replace one in the same rec room. I'd recommend this dishwasher, provided you don't mind a little effort getting it dialed in
kitchen & housewares||1.0||I cannot believe what a WASTE of money this thing was. HUGE disappointment. I was all excited when I got it, made some cookie press dough, put it in, and... nothing. The plunger pretty much spins in place. I could PUSH the dough out manually faster than this thing can. I couldn't even get ONE FREAKIN' cookie out of it, onto the cookie sheet. DON'T buy this sorry excuse of plastic waste, and if you do, don't say you weren't warned. I probably would have more constructive criticism, but #1 This product isn't worth the effort, and #2 I spent ALL effing evening saying to myself, "It CAN'T be this bad. It must work somehow." Ummmm... NOPE!!!!

kitchen & housewares||5.0||I have been extremely happy with this set of knives, and for only $40 I believe them to be an excellent value. The blades are sharp and well constructed, and the handles are comfortable and seem durable. The set only comes with two long knives, so you may find yourself washing them while cooking, but we like to use the steak knives for chopping smaller vegetables or trimming meat and have thus rarely found that we are short on knives while cooking. If you're looking to do professional work, these knives probably won't fit your needs, but for an average cook, we use them a lot and haven't found anything they can't handle. Plus, you are getting the set for about $3 per knife, and these knives would run at least $10 to $15 each if purchased individually or at a local retailer.  
kitchen & housewares||1.0||I bought this item on sale at Shopko, where it will be returned today.  I froze the gel disk as instructed, bought all the ingredients listed in the recipe booklet for vanilla ice cream, cooled the ingredients after mixing as instructed.  After 45 minutes of mixing I ended up with ice cream soup. You could let this thing run forever and never end up with ice cream that is set up enough to eat.  I put it in a container in the freezer.  The next morning I had an ice cream brick.  Not to be deterred I microwaved it for 15 seconds until it was soft enough to actually remove with my metal ice cream scoop.  This stuff gets harder than cement!  After all this work the ice cream had a bad plastic-like aftertaste.  I had to throw it all out.  If this isn't enough to deter you keep in mind that the "heavy cream" called for in most of the recipes listed in the booklet costs a pretty hefty price.  I paid $2.50 for the heavy cream listed to make 1.5 quarts of ice cream.  That price doesn't even include the other ingredients listed.  Buyer Beware
kitchen & housewares||5.0||We're a busy family of four. This product has so many more uses than our old toaster plus it cooks fast & it's simple to use! This has been a great alternative to heating up the oven for a few pieces of cheese bread or a snack pizza. I was surprised at how evenly everything cooks. We've been very pleased with this product, in fact it has become an essential appliance. The only draw back is that it takes up more counter space however that con is overweighed by all the pros. I never thought I'd give up my old toaster, now I wish I'd done it ten years ago!

kitchen & housewares||1.0||Why would anyone want pots that can't be used on high heat, can't be washed in the dishwasher or can't be scoured for fear of removing their anodized finish.  My Calphalon professional pots were very expensive and it makes me sick that they have preformed so poorly.  I have noticed that many of the positive reviews were by people who haven't owned these pots for longI am a real cook and use my pots several times a day, I need them to work, not just look good and this cookware is ridiculously tempermental.  After leaving them on the heat too long, just once, they warp.  Food sticks easily to them and they are very hard to clean because you can't use steelwool or abrasive pads.  After a guest put one in a dishwasher by mistake, the pot finish was ruined, and I had aluminum coming off on my food.  I am someone who takes good care of my things, and it is impossible to clean these well without removing the finish.  I had taken some  comfort in the "lifetime" warantee, I tried to return them, but the warantee, like this cookware is absolutely useless

Hovering in the background of their tragedies and occasional, brief glimpses of happiness, is their distant cousin, the scheming, greedy, conniving, ruthless cousin, the Count.Given the concept of the story, this poster fits perfectly, with the orphans, standing together but otherwise alone, in the middle, with the shadow of the Count casting gloom upon them.  It is a perfect fit, as is the casting of Jim Carrey as the Count

kitchen & housewares||1.0||I needed a compact cleaner to tidy up after my delightful cat decided to soil my couch.  I had read other reviews of the Bissell Little Green Machine that were unfavourable, so headed off to the store to find something else . . . . the Atlantis Express looked interesting, and I hadn't seen it before.Suffice to say, it did get the cat stains out of the couch, but not after revealing itself as a really poorly designed product.- The machine is LOUD, very loud- The cleaning 'head' on the end of the hose has a 'flip-up' cover to make it easier to clean where it sucks in lint and stuff into the machine.  That is a great idea, but there is no gasket to make the joints true and tight . . .. so while it may have 2 times the power of other machines based on sheer power of the motor, it looses some of this power when you actually use it to try and suck water and cleaning solution back up.- The option to spray water and solution or just clean water is part of what appealed to me about this machine.  However to accomplish this, the cleaning head has 2 seperate spayers on the underside.  Neither are centered, the one on the left operates when you have the slider set to solution and the one to the right operates when you have slider set to rinse.  As they are not centered, they overspray quite a bit past the edge of the cleaning tool. Mine sprayed a wide swath of rinse water about 3 inches past the edge of the cleaning head.  To top it off, when you release the trigger, the cleaning head continues to drip water for a few moments, meaning that you have to go VERY slowly or risk dripping everywhere.While it functioned well enough to clean my couch, it was a brutal and terrible experience.  When I bought it I figured it could be used too on my car interior . . . . but the frustration of cleaning a small patch on my couch quickly quelled that thougt.I returned the Atlantis Express to the store and went out and bought a Hoover Steam Vac Jr. -- which I should have done right from the start--- the hoover runs circles around this machine

kitchen & housewares||5.0||Enough said.DON'T PUT A FROZEN JAR ON THE BASE AND YOU WON'T HAVE TO REPLACE THE BLADE ASSEMBLY.  I am sure the owners manual says that someplace.My Kitchen Aid became unusable because replacement blades were not available 16 months after I purchased it.  Aren't you glad you could purchase the replacement part?My story:  My son put his leftover smoothie into the freezer, jar and all.  The next day when he took the jar out of the freezer and put it on the Kitchen Aid blender, the motor broke the blade assembly.  The motor base was still good and I liked the blender.  Kitchen Aid changed their model and didn't make replacement parts.  I think it is unreasonable for a manufacturer to not have replacement parts available after just 16 months.  (...)!I can't say enough good things about the quality and ease of use of my Cuisinart blender.  The jar's shape helps the food move and mix better than a round jar.  The jar's size is larger than any I have found.  I pour from the corner of the jar if the mix is too thick to pour from the spout (which I concede is a little wide).  The weight keeps the blender in place.  The shipping weight is around 15 LBS is that too heavy?  Maybe you should skip the smoothies and switch to a muscle building drink.  Most every quality blender has weight to it.  The plastic units are light and considered disposable.  Keep buying those $30 disposable blenders if you want, however I'll keep my Cuisinart!The three year warranty and Cuisinart's backing keep us, the consumer, in parts when we do something stupid (like putting the frozen smoothie mix on the blender and breaking the blade assembly).  (...) replacement blade assembly is cheaper than being FORCED to purchase a new blender (Kitchen Aid).Buy the Cuisinart a great value for a quality product.

For the first few weeks it seemed to evenly brown the bread but since then it has become the worst toaster I have ever owned.  It is impossible to get evenly browned bread instead you get burnt crust and blotches of brown randomly scattered over the bread.  SAVE YOUR MONEY.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT
kitchen & housewares||5.0||This is my favorite salad spinner, and I've tried several over the last couple years.  It dries my lettuce very well, and has some useful features that I haven't seen in other spinners.Like the old Zyliss spinner, you pull on a handle to spin the basket.  But with this one the more you pull, the faster it spins, kind of like revving up a top or something.   It spins much faster than those 'crank' spinners or the 'push down' type -and faster spinning means more water off your veggies.As for the new features, here are my top five: 1) The lid is clear, so you can see the veggies spinning around in there and make sure you're not overfilling the spinner, the lettuce isnt bunching up in one corner, etc. OK, it's also just mesmerizing to watch your food spin round and round.  Kind of like watching your clothes roll around in the dryer.2) There is a brake! So after you've whipped  your veggies into a frenzy, you can slam them to a stop -which also helps get more water off.  This works better on the small sized spinner, since there is less weight to stop, but even on the big spinner it works very well.  I have seen a brake on another spinner, but this one works much better.3) The cord pulls itself back in -and gently: I disliked how the old 'string' spinners would yank on your arm, and if you didn't respond just right the string wouldn't pull in at all: it ends up just sitting there in a pile.  You'd have to take the lid off and wind it up yourself!  This new design winds the cord up every time.4) The basket is smooth on the inside -that's something I defintely have not seen before.  It's a subtle feature, but very helpful: it helps make sure little bits of your lettuce dont get stuck in the basket when you're cleaning it out.5) You can stack things on top of it, both in the fridge and in the cupboard, because the top is mostly flat.  The handle even sits in its own little pocket in the lid so that it's not in the way.  In my house fridge space is valuable and I appreciate being able to stack this spinner like I do with my tupperware.So, overall I am impressed with this spinner (so impressed that I've also given it as a gift!).  It does its job very well and has thoughtful extra features which make it more helpful around the kitchen

kitchen & housewares||5.0||I immediately noticed the quality of this wok as soon as I took it out of the box. Very nice looking. Very easy to cook in. It's big and has large sides so it is very easy to stir the stir fry around without spilling it. The non stick surface works beautifully. Reattaching the wok to the base after cleaning is fairly easy although the wok never seems to lock 100% correctly into place without a little hassle. I'm not sure it really matters if it's not perfectly 100% aligned into the base anyway. Nevertheless, that's only a minor gripe. This wok makes stir fry easy and fun and makes the food taste really good. The included spatula was a nice gesture, too. The instructions say the wok can do a lot of other things too, like slow cooking, but I only use it for stir fry

kitchen & housewares||4.0||I've used these for months to protect tile countertops and they basically work except they start bending after a while on the edges and something light (like an empty glass)tends to fall over.  They are heavy duty and I put hot items on them with no problems
kitchen & housewares||5.0||The attachments that are available for KitchenAid mixers are worth their weight in gold. This is the most recent attachment I've purchased for my mixer. I can't tell you how much time was saved when making apple butter and apple relish for the holiday season. This time of year, saving time is a good thing when there doesn't seem to be enough time for everything on your LISTS!!! Happy Holidays
kitchen & housewares||5.0||This listing fails to mention that these dishes are from the Ultra line which are significantly thicker and heavier than just the normal square dishes Corelle has recently released.  This is fabulous because I was concerned that the old Corelle I remember is a bit thin. These carry a 5-year warranty vs. the regular 3-yr.This pattern is more beautiful in person; the leaves have a great texture to them. The pattern is softer and less "limey" in person (in a good way). Don't shy away from Corelle because they aren't known for style (I almost did). The durability and beauty of these dishes are unmatched in my opinion.  Purchased two sets for special occassion dinners and everyday use
kitchen & housewares||5.0||This is a great set of dinnerware!! After 25 years, my husband and I decided to bring some color into our lives by replacing our wedding gift white Corelle with festive FiestaWare. How lovely to open the cabinets and see color!!! We've mixed colors and have an eight piece display of color. FiestaWare is not only beautiful, but durable.  And it can be put in the dishwasher, microwave, oven and freezer!!! It may cost a bit more than some of the trendy stuff available, but it's adaptability to all uses makes it a fabulous value!!! If you are at all tempted by it --- BUY IT!!!! You will LOVE it! Put some color in your life
kitchen & housewares||4.0||As advertised, and described in various reviews, the blender is solid, powerful and loud....very loud. I have to block my ears when it's running but I had expected that so I'm not complaining.   My one complaint is that the "water tight" lid is not and if I fill it up too full liquid comes out the top.I use it for fruit smoothies (no ice) and vegetable soups and they come out very smooth
kitchen & housewares||4.0||This pan is very easy to clean.  However, the small base won't sit stably on my gas range.  I keep a hand on the handle and pay attention to how it sits on the range to overcome the problem
kitchen & housewares||1.0||I bought a Haier RTC1700SS oven from Amazon about a month ago. I am still waiting for a replacement from Haier because the trays & spit did not fit.I hope by this summer I will know what it's like to cook on a con- vection oven. I'll let you know if I ever get a chance to use the one I've already paid for
kitchen & housewares||1.0||i have a lot of experience with steamers over the years - mine as well as others used in stores. stupid me, then, for not realizing that you get what you pay for. my jiffy steamer finally died after nine years, but it served me well. it is a machine of substance, solid parts, very stable. trust me - you don't want to scrimp when it comes to working with a device designed to produce streams of hot steam! i foolishly tried to save some money by getting the conair gs10rh, and i'm returning it immediately. the well into which the telescoping pole sits is just about 1 inch deep - not deep enough to keep the pole stable. the brackets to hold the telescoped parts extended aren't firm - any heavy jacket will make them slide. the housing itself is amazingly lightweight; i thought that was a good thing, but now i know why the jiffy steamer's housing seems like it weighs a ton - you really do want the unit to be solidly anchored. handling a steamer is a serious matter. don't take on unnecessary risk by getting an inexpensive, poorly designed, lightweight steamer like the conair. spend the extra money for the product that has been the standard bearer for years: jiffy. you won't regret it. and even though mine died after nine years, i have no regrets, and now i'll do the right thing and get another
kitchen & housewares||5.0||I've had 2 sets of these simple but marvelous mats so far, not only the handiest thing I've bought for my kitchen, but friends keep talking me into giving them one. I only need one or two but one is always on my countertop for various uses the past few years.I'm a senior lady and disabled, and my time standing in the kitchen is limited so I hate cleaning up messes, picking up dropped stuff on the floor, sterilizing unweildy wood or plastic cutting boards. Mainly love the ease of chopping or slicing vegies on it, folding it over like a funnel and dumping right into a salad bowl or a pan with NO SPILLS, or vegies onto another can't do without item, faithful George Foreman Grill, beside my meat entree. Top down, vegies and meat dinner in 4 minutes.So simple to just put under the faucet and run hot water over it, or wipe with a little bleach on a sponge. Very few knife marks on mine, but I don't like super sharp knives, and if I seldom have to cut meat I use a scissors and wax paper on the mat to then wrap and freeze pieces. I buy boneless skinless chicken or pork or sirloin chops. The grill gets a once over with a damp paper towel. So simple and time saver, not like cuts on a wooden board which is most unsanitary. Beyond a slicing surface, great for placing cannisters on to fill with coffee or sugar, salt shakers, or stuff I seem to always have to spill some, shakey hands at 70. Just roll it up, shake in the trash or sink disposal, rinse if necessary and reuse, keeps counter clean and free of stains. I put hot or cold things on it to protect the formica, made a few stains with coffee but cleans with bleach ok, not ruining my counter top. They wear well but at the price, and the work they save they can be tossed for another new one. Best features are flexible enough to roll and empty, easy cleanup forget the broom, and no storage problem in my cramped space - stack them on the counter and peel top one off for next job.Besides these mats and the elec non stick grill, my micro rice steamer is the third CDW to make food preparation easier than ever in my life. If I spill dry rice filling it, roll and dump in the cooker. I am not kitchen friendly, want to spend as little time on my feet as possible, hate to cook, hate cleaning up, dinner in 6 minutes and I'm done. So glad to see these are on the web, had a hard time finding more in stores when I want to gift someone. If you want the job done clean and fast, tired of bending picking up rollaway strays off the floor (or always between stove and counter narrow space) buy these for a staple in a kitchen, especially for seniors - I've no dishwasher nor disposal I might add. Why in the world would one need a cutting board heat resistant? not for oven or stovetop use. For glue guns and crafts which I also do, put a piece of wax paper over your extra mat if you want to protect a table top, I use one on my desk and serves as a coaster too. I didn't even know about the silicone part, who cares. Just can't rave enough over these. Saves work, saves time
kitchen & housewares||1.0||I have been a chef now for seven years and have not ever had a problem with pyrex.  Until now.  Last night while roasting some potatoes in a 400F oven, my pyrex dish exploded.  It rained glass all over the inside of my oven.  It was a disaster.  I am just thankful that nothing happened to me or my two year old who was in the room at that time.  This sounds like a REAL PROBLEM! 
kitchen & housewares||5.0||This Whisk is far superior to any other I have owned. I cook constantly and a whisk is a necessary tool. This one is sturdy, reliable, and stands up to the most viscous mixtures. Kitchenaid is the way to go for all of your appliance and cookware needs
kitchen & housewares||5.0||I have a few of these wash clothes sitting in my bathroom closet.  They're beautiful in design and give you an excellent clean feeling after you've used them (with soap and water, of course).  Looking forward to a shower just got a whole lot better
kitchen & housewares||5.0||This food chopper is my favorite extra appliance in the kitchen.  For salsas, the low speed lets me keep the ingredients chunky. For sauces, the higher speed can easily puree most ingredients. My favorite item to use it for is onions and it saves alot of tears.  The large bowl not only holds alot, but is also very  easy to clean. I highly recommend this food chopper for frequent or casual dicing cook
kitchen & housewares||5.0||Especially for your guests. But you could use them in your master-bath, of course. The pile & embroidery design is very pretty & very quality looking. I bought towels & hand towels after I was so pleased with the first batch.  They are absorbant and the color is a yummy butter-creamy. And, a great buy. What more can you ask for
kitchen & housewares||5.0||I didn't have a bundt pan, and I found this one when I went in search of one.  I'm so glad!!!  I've only had it a week, but have used it 4 times!!  Has a very unique shape
kitchen & housewares||1.0||Product not even worth a penny. Impossible to use after the first wash..Wont recommend to anyon
kitchen & housewares||1.0||I got this pasta maker as a gift, and after the first use the knob used to set the thickness of the pasta broke off and so did a piece of the handle used to turn the rollers.  All it would make after that is a flat piece of pasta with varying thickness.  The company is going to charge me to send it to them and back, even if they decide to exchange the product, and all correspondences must be done by mail (no call-in number) so I'm not even hopeful for an exchange
kitchen & housewares||1.0||Amazon seems to experience a disproportionate number of "pricing errors".  Whenever you attempt to purchase anything at Amazon that represents a 50% or higher discount, don't expect to receive it.  Poor business practices
kitchen & housewares||5.0||This is my third Rowenta iron and they have all served me well, but this is by far the best.  The steam is amazing. You only have to made one pass on most items. I know it is a lot of money for an iron but it is worth every penny for the time it saves
kitchen & housewares||4.0||They are very big, the spoons are very uncomfortable to use, they should have been smaller. and a better grip
kitchen & housewares||2.0||I splurged on this pan because I was tired of the "wobble" my cheaper pans developed on my smooth glass cooktop. This pan warped severely after only 4 months, not any better than pans a fraction of the cost. I plan on returning it for replacement, and will use the new one for low temperature sauces only
kitchen & housewares||4.0||I purchashed the Professional Series Tortilla Baker PS75791 to add healthy tortillas to my diet. I grind my own wheat berries and grow my oun yeast to make bread that is as fresh as it can be and is completed in 4 hours after grinding. A loaf cost just about 15 cents. I wanted to make freshly ground wheat tortillas for the cost savings and for the superior nutrition. I am very pleased with the results. I grind my wheat, but leave out the oil because I submurge my doe in olive oil so it will keep fresh for days in my frig and then work the oil into the doe just before pressing and cooking. The machine really works, and its easy to use. It a quality machine and is a mainstay of my healthy kitchen
kitchen & housewares||5.0||I have to say, I have been needing a meat pounder for a long time and this one is great.  I used it on chicken and it did a great job with very little effort on my part.  Plus is was very easy to clean, just some soap and water.  I am very pleased with this item
kitchen & housewares||1.0||Have been using the set for less than a month. Rust has started to form on the knives just where the blades are fused to the handles - right at the seams. Looks like rust starts from the inside of the handle. Unless design is changed, don't know how replacement knives will be any different. Too bad since knives are sharp and set is designed beautifully
kitchen & housewares||1.0||The decription says it is a 9x5 loaf loaf dish.  I was thrilled. I have been looking all over to find one that size in glass.  I was so mad and disappointed when I opened the box and it was 8.5 x 4.5.  That wasn't what I ordered.  And yes when baking bread there is a difference.  I am still waiting on my postage-paid return label so I can ship this back. This would have been a great deal, except I already have the 8.5 x 4.5 pans.  They need to change the dimensions in the description.  Buyer beware!
kitchen & housewares||1.0||This product does separate the fat BUT small bits of meat or vegetables will stop up the spout and the plastic is not heat resistant. Mine cracked the first time I used it and after the second use it had to go in the trash can
kitchen & housewares||2.0||It's great, if it works!!!  After keep exchanging it over and over, I gave up the 5th time. First time, spray didn't work, second time, power steam button didn't release the steam, third time, it was too strong fabric got stock underneath the iron and I couldn't clean the iron, fourth time, steam problem again, fifth time, steam problem again. Poorly tested product. I would've been really happy to keep it, if it was working properly. It actually had all the features I was looking for. Too bad for Rowenta for not testing their products properly.
kitchen & housewares||5.0||So when it came up on my Gold Box offers, I knew I had to have it !  It is great !  Beautiful, sleek and also useful !  It looks great in my yellow kitchen too !  The pitcher is heavy duty without feeling too heavy.  Makes a nice piece on your table during that special dinner at home 
kitchen & housewares||1.0||I bought two sets of these about 4 months ago.  After the first time in the dishwasher I noticed little tarnish/rusty looking spots.  They rubbed off fairly easily, but as time has gone by, they are looking very bad.  Tonight while eating, I got a sliver in my finger from the fork!  I have NEVER had a piece of flatware peel.  I'm going back to my old flatware.  Sure glad I saved it!  DON'T BUY THIS JUNK
kitchen & housewares||1.0||I thought that this would actually be something that I would need when I registered for this for my wedding. But this is more of a toy for the kitchen than something that you will actually use. Sure kids might like to use it when they cook, but in all the time that I have owned one, I have only used it once. Its more of a hassle because you have to clean it out afterwards. You are better off without it
kitchen & housewares||4.0||I cooked 2 cobblers for our scout troop that even the pickiest eater was coming back for more.Terrific piece for any campers , practically a must have
kitchen & housewares||1.0||A normal coffee maker requires a quick rinse; this machine requires a wash, rinse and a thorough drying of the grinding unit.  You can't just rinse the grinding unit because the fine coffee grounds need to be washed out.If it wasn't for the fact that we spent nearly $100 for this unit, I would throw it away.SAVE YOUR MONEY - DON'T BUY IT
kitchen & housewares||5.0||... and I don't even make Custard! *LOL*  I just love these for small servings of ice cream, fruit, side dishes, etc.  They are great with meals for anything that you don't want to mix with the other foods on your plate.  They are perfect for snacks and desserts.  They are great for things such as pickles, olives, chopped onions, relish, dips, etc. on a casual buffet or picnic table.  They also work well for pre-portioning ingredients when making a complicated recipe or allowing younger kids to cook with you.  The typical Pyrex glass which is thick and a bit heavy is perfect for my family because it holds up to less than gentle everyday use.  I still want my children to learn to be careful with china and glassware, but I see no reason to be too 'precious' about everday dishware
kitchen & housewares||5.0||Excellent product for the value. I was hesitant to purchase china via internet or mail, but the china arrived in perfect condition, and is beautiful and timeless. Thank you.
kitchen & housewares||1.0||I cannot recommend purchase of the refurbished Roomba Discovery 4210. While I think the product did a good job on BARE floors (not carpet), now after only 4 months of light use (we only used in the kitchen/den area of our home), the unit is trashed. The refurb warranty is only 90 days and that's apparently all the machine is good for. I purchased a new APS fast charger in an attempt to rule that problem out, but it did nothing. This seems to be typical of this vacuum since the Roomba rep I talked to told me that if the charger failed the Roomba was "probably trashed". She was right. If you want  to try this machine stick with the new one, at least you'll get a one year warranty. But I recommend staying away altogether
kitchen & housewares||5.0||These glasses are superb in quality and appearance. The purchaser should be aware that they are of the smaller type of martini glass, more the original size, rather than the wide mouth styles you see in some stores today
kitchen & housewares||1.0||I received this grinder because I had purchased a defective Melitta Grind & Brew coffee maker through Amazon.  The coffee maker had electrical problems and I sent it back to the manufacturer as the manual instructed.  To make a very long story short---Melitta was not able to replace the coffee maker.  They stopped making them.  Amazon had my money and I waited over 4 frustrating months for a coffee maker.  Amazon would not help me and after many, many phone calls Melitta sent me another coffee maker and the coffee mill to compensate for the Brew and Grind.  Grinder malfunctioned periodically and finally died with in 9 months. WARNING--DON'T BUY MELITTA PRODUCTS AND RETURNS FOR DEFECTIVE MERCHANDISE SHOULD BE RETURNED TO AMAZON. 
kitchen & housewares||1.0||I received this as a gift for Christmas. It worked like a charm for ice cream and lemon slush 3 times. BUT then, the base burst in my freezer, spewing foul scented goo all over. I contacted the manufacturer to ask how to get it replaced, and NEVER HEARD BACK. Apparently they don't care about backing up their product. Now I have to buy another one, and it won't be this brand
kitchen & housewares||5.0||I have the four piece set of these silicone utensils, and have been very pleased with them.  They are heat resistant, heavy-duty, and look sharp.   They are slightly flexible, but I have not found this to be a problem unless you want to do heavy scraping with the turner.   The best part is the wonderful easy-clean properties of the silicone.   My other heat-resistant utensils always look icky and need to be scrubbed with a scouring pad to clean the textured finish.   These look great right out of the dishwasher!   I've had them for a year and they've held up great.   The turner has not disintegrated on the edge, either, like many other types do.  The smooth finish allows food to slip right off without sticking as you're cooking
kitchen & housewares||4.0||This is the simplest, but one of the best kitchen must haves I have purchased in a long time.  The peel is whisked of the garlic in seconds.  Easy to clean, easy to store.  No more garlic hands
kitchen & housewares||4.0||Lots of reviews already, so let's not waste your time:Pros:- easy to setup (no waiting for charcoal or having to buy propane)- easy to clean- practical. U can use it indoor/outdoor- No flames, so it's quite hard to actually burn the foodCons:- Doesn't cook the food 100% evenly. Noticed that the area around the thermostat is hotter. Not by much though, but you can notice the grill marks on the food stronger when near the thermostat- Doesn't get really really hot. If you're trying to cook Brazilian style (large chunk of meat), it might not work out. However, it's great if you cut it into smaller chunks of meat.Overall:I love this so much that some days I use this for lunch and for dinner. There are no pans to clean. Only reason I don't give 5 stars is because it's not even throughout the whole plate.
kitchen & housewares||4.0||The Villaware Panini Grill has proved to be a very useful appliance, so much so that I leave it out on the counter - it's quite attractive, and certainly not an eyesore.  I use it often, for grilled sandwiches, of course, but also for grilled meats and fish.  I would caution users to avoid meat with bones, e.g. lamb chops(you can't get a good sear when the bone keeps the surface of the meat away from the grill), and to be very careful about timing: things get done twice as fast!  While the cleaning "comb" is useful to get most of the remaining food or fat off the grill, you still need to fold a paper towel and clean each groove separately; much easier to do if the grill is warm (not hot).  I haven't tried grilling vegetables, yet, but it should work perfectly on zucchini sliced the long way, or eggplant, or peppers.I am very happy with the quality of this product
kitchen & housewares||2.0||I bought this iron based on the recommendations here and was terribly dissapointed. First of all, the iron is very big and heavy. That's not really a problem by itself, but when the iron leaves wrinkles on a shirt as much as it did, it becomes a big problem. The controls were hard to deal with. Turning the iron on and to the setting desired involved getting under the holder. I can see someone burning their hand on a hot iron by accidentally reaching underneath to get a grip in order to work the controls on a hot iron.The water receiver only accepts water when the iron is laying flat. Well, that's fine if the iron isn't hot, but what if you decide you need water while ironing? The steam controls either don't work on the unit I have, or they don't work similar to any other iron I've used. This iron is far worse than the Sunbeam I'm trying to replace due to inherent problems and leaks
kitchen & housewares||1.0||Wish I had seen the reviews before purchasing this insane appliance.  Nothing "slow" about it-- burns everything, even on the Keep Warm setting.  Best you can get out of it is 4 hours before you absolutely have to return home and shut it off.  If not, your evening meal is small burnt pieces of food welded to the bottom of the pot. I swear, this thing is possessed!  My old Rival Crock Pot was the best appliance I ever purchased, this one is the WORST!
kitchen & housewares||5.0||I have been very happy with this cookware. It is very well made, heavy and sturdy. This is the most expensive set I have ever bought, and the difference is stunning. The pans heat very quickly and get much hotter than my old pans.  I have had to change my cooking style to accommodate the better pans. I like being able to put them in the oven and not worrying about caring for a (possibly) toxic non-stick coating. Well worth the money
kitchen & housewares||4.0||I don't know how anyone could think that the outlast material isn't working.  (..of course it has been significantly tested and proven that it works.)  At first its cool.  After about 5 minutes (depending on the person) outlast starts keeping an even temp..  Now that even temp. may not be as cool as you want - but it never gets much warmer than you are UNLIKE most every other pillow (..even buckwheat pillows which become hotter because of the fabric encasing the buckwheat).The negatives are however:1. The outlast material needs to be pretty close to your body to work - and it DOES have a distinctive texture that is a broad weave box pattern and is "stiff" (..though after a few washings it becomes considerably softer).  You might not like this textural feeling.2. Other than the outlast, the pillow is nothing special.  The support is poor like most pillows, the interesting thing here though is that you can remove the stuffing - and fill it with a material you find acceptable (..if you don't like the standard poly fill), but you will need to do some minor sewing on the seam you opened to remove and replace the filling
kitchen & housewares||1.0||Initially, my dogs found the sound interesting and slowed down on barking, but after a couple of days they acted like they didn't even hear the sound. Now, they are back to "bark all you want"
kitchen & housewares||1.0||I bought one of these to make Bagna Cauda, and upon loading the necessary ingredients and depressing the "high" button, it sparked and died. Well, ok, I guess it only *half* died, as the "pulse" button would still work, if I leaned on it with my entire weight, but both the "high" and "low" switch settings did nothing. So I'm thinking next time I'll spend a little more; meanwhile, this little guy goes back
kitchen & housewares||5.0||This flatware set is beautiful enough for special occasions but practical enough for everyday family use. We wash it in a dishwasher with no special treatment and it comes out shining everytime. My family love the solid feel of the forks
kitchen & housewares||1.0||My knives started to rust after 3wks of use.  I didn't put them in the dishwasher either.  I just leave them in the sink w/the dirty dishes till I'm ready to wash.  But that shouldn't be the problem.  I have a cheap $3 butcher's knife from chinatown that hasn't rusted yet and I treat that one the same
kitchen & housewares||5.0||I love this pan.  As for cooking: This pan does a great job on steaks, burgers, chicken, whatever. Leaves really nice grill marks. The only thing you will need to do is have a cover or splatter shield for it.  I use a 16" round cover from a much bigger pan just to avoid some of the little drops of grease spattering out on my range.  This seems to work just find for me.As for Cleaning:  I let it cool a little after cooking and pour some water (no soap!) into the bottom of the pan while it is just hot enough for the water to boil a little, and using a wooden spatula (only use wood in this pan), I scrape all the fond away (burnt tasty bits stuck to the pan) and pour into the sink.  I repeat this once or twice and put the pan back on the heat and wipe it down with a paper towel.  I then use some supermarket brand canola oil spray and lightly coat the inside while the pan is still warm. Takes about 2 minutes to do this.  I store this pan in my oven since it tends to have a light coat of oil on it all the time. This pan is so well worth the hand cleaning to have especially since I live in an apartment and don't have access to a grill
kitchen & housewares||2.0||Well reviewed on amazon but this kettle is lacking. The copper does, indeed, boil water fast; and that's the job of a kettle, I admit. However, the button/trigger that opens the spout is too close to the steam and you're forever guarding your fingers and shying away from the kettle. As you tilt the kettle to pour, you're also tilting the steam nearer to your fingers. It's uncomfortable at best and searing at worst. While you learn how to not get scalded, this kettle is always at least slightly irritating.  There are better kettles around
kitchen & housewares||5.0||The KitchenAid line of silicone utensils are positively perfect.  They are very will made and excellent quality.  The silicone material is amazing, it is so easy to clean, whether you are using this mixing spatula with cake mix, cookie dough or anything you are mixing or scraping nothing will sticks to it.  The curved design on this spatula is a perfect match to the KitchenAid stand mixer bowl and it also works very well with my All Clad mixing bowls.  With this spatula you will not miss a drop of anything in the bowl.  Highly recommended
kitchen & housewares||5.0||These spoons are great.  They are very sturdy and easy to use, and the finish on the metal is a nice touch.  Overall, practical and attractive
kitchen & housewares||1.0||This is NOT Aubergine, a dark purple like the color of eggplant skin, but it is a light, bright purple. Sitting on my kitchen countertop, it is a very formidable sight first thing in the morning; glowing, shimmering in kitchen flourescent lighting. Caveat emptor, unless you're color blind or really like bright purple
kitchen & housewares||5.0||Pyrex is always the best!  This enormous measuring cup is great for melting in the microwave and for a homemade double boiler in any pot.  The lid is a hard plastic top with flexible sides that seal up tight so you can use it to store things in the fridge and to carry things places.  Also the cover is safe for both freezer and microwave use (but not the oven) and is dishwasher safe in the top rack.  The cover has three pouring choices, a regular pour spout, a slotted spout, and a spout with seven little holes.  An extremely useful item to have in the kitchen
kitchen & housewares||4.0||Works very well.  Only drawback it's large - but stands upright.Well worth the money and quit in the low speed.
kitchen & housewares||1.0||Got this product by mistake from Chef's tools.  Grinding mechanism is made of plastic and it does not grind pepper.  Have the Black Magnum and is the best peppermill ever, (thats why we wanted a second one for the kitchen).  Our black peppermill did not come from Chef's tools
kitchen & housewares||5.0||If you want to pay over $100 you can find much better quality, but for 70% less this is a fantastic value
kitchen & housewares||2.0||Pros: The oven part works great. I like the fact that it is controlled by a timer, meaning that you can set somthing to cook for 20 minutes and then it turns itself off.  For cooking things, the double rack is also handy, although you only get one pan (luckily, I saved the pan from my old toaster oven).  Cons: The toaster part is horrible.  This thing burns my toast every time, unless I watch it carefully and take it out at precisely the right time.  Part of the problem seems to be that the timer doesn't work very well in small increments, and in some cases never turns itself off.  Also, the bottom rack is completely useless when toasting, so the fact that they are touting this as a 6-slice toaster oven is misleading. 
kitchen & housewares||1.0||The replacement filters for the SV726 do not fit and are not the same shape as the filter that came with the Shark Vac
kitchen & housewares||1.0||I've used these type of units all the time until I got my own.  It stopped sealing, and I haven't had a chance to use up the bags that came with it!  When I called, they said it was probably the heat tape that went bad and they can't fix it.  They offered to sell me a new one though!  I have no idea where my receipt is (my fault).  I have to have another one, so I'm going to buy the cheapest one so I don't feel so bad when I have to replace it in 6 months to a year
kitchen & housewares||5.0||This unit does everything it is designed to do.  Have used it several times now and the only question we have is, when do we change the oil? ..... we think it's kinda like your car, if it looks and smells bad .... dump it ... grin !
kitchen & housewares||5.0||This cooking/serving stainless steel slotted spoon, like the rest of the products from the OXO Good Grips line, is a great value of superior quality, unsurpassed durability, and flawless performance. Its ergonomic design, hefty body, and big, pressure-absorbing, non-slip grip, complete with flexible fins to accommodate your fingers, are the reasons why you'll prefer this product to the more traditional models, as they will allow you comfortable, daily, wet or dry use while keeping you away from any stress-related injuries.Its elegant, stylized shape makes it perfect to use either in the kitchen or at the dinner table, and it also comes with an oversized hole at the tip of the handle for easy hanging, and a strong, stout neck guaranteed to be unbendable.Overall, this spoon is perfect to strain vegetables, fruits, shrimp and other foods, and its easy to clean, simple construction and dishwasher-safe, hardwearing materials make it an addition that will prove a dependable part of your cooking equipment for years. Furthermore, its stainless-steel metal parts will permanently keep your rust worries away. After submitting this product to over three years of normal, everyday use, mine is still just like new.--Reviewed by Maritza Volma
kitchen & housewares||1.0||This is the worst basting brush I have ever encountered.  At first countless bristles fell out in my food and every time I washed it.  (Although it's dishwasher safe, it failed to come clean in there, even after a big squirt of dawn and much hand washing it isn't spotless, but I think I pulled most of the loose bristles out in the process.)  It also doesn't stand up to any heat, I use it to lightly grease my griddle for pancakes and things (at about 375 degrees) becuase I don't like the residue left by Pam, and it shrinks and flakes bristle bits every time.  I also don't like the Good Grips in general (these were a gift) the handles are too bulky and take up too much space in my utensil crock and limited apartment kitchen drawers

Don't get me wrong, I still HATE ironing, but at least now its over a lot faster.  Plus, the iron is always at the right temperature for whatever I'm ironing, and its easy to fill with water.  The only thing I'd like is a retractable cord, but it isn't a real cause for complaint

Also the supports on the side for the top will need to be driven on using a hammer, or large chunk of scrap wood. The fit on mine was too tight to be simply slid on. Construction is the cam type that is popular now. All pieces are adequately labled, and small hardware comes nicely packaged; the most convenient I have ever seen. There is an error in the assembly documentation. There are two pieces (1B and 1C, the table sides) which are as far as I can tell are identical. After hardware is installed as indicated on pabe 6 of 13 there is a difference. The two sides are mirror images. On the following page part 1C is shown but labled 1B. This error did not cause me a problem during assembly. The intent was clear to me.The looks are good. It looks a little clunky to achieve an excellent rating from me. A little milling would help a lot on the drawer face

It never fails, when I need to make a really important call-- the static is so loud I can't hear at all. Every time we use it the static interrupts our conversation because we can't hear. And Target wouldn't take it back without the box--How long are we supposed to keep the box- reasonably!

Thinking that they would match the pieces I already owned, I was quite disappointed when I received BLACK instead of the BLUE I ordered. I returned them and Amazon replaced them with another set of BLACK pans. I decided to keep them but am quite upset, with my only alternative being to return them for credit.Keep in mind that these are NOT the heavy Stainless Steel, but the lighter weight ALUMINUM. You will NOT be able to mistreatthese pans by turning the flame up on full. To do so will causethe pans to warp.The advantage to these pans is that they are LIGHTWEIGHT and easyto handle. I definitely recommend them. As with all TEFLON coated pans, be sure to use the PLASTICutensils and NEVER use any metal spoons or turners or you willruin the Teflon surface. With a little care these will last foryears!TIP: If you're having trouble with the bottom of your pots andpans getting a scorched or burnt look, it's from GREASE. Whenyou wash your pans, make sure all the grease is cleaned off ofthe outside bottom of the pans
kitchen & housewares||1.0||I strongly agree with the last reviewer- this unit is EXTREMELY OVERPRICED.  I also have a all-metal zinc alloy unit that included 2 extra worms, aluminum foilcutter, stainless steel bottle stopper and pourer and gift box for $25.  This one, at $150, still has a plastic body

kitchen & housewares||1.0||We had this machine at work and made maybe 6 cups a day on a busy day. Within a month the machine broke - Keurig did replace it right away but then the second broke as well (a co worker bought one for his home and had the same problem!!). they gave us an upgrade on the model and this one is still going. The Coffee was good but the tea was not. Most importantly people is IT IS WASTEFUL. WITH LITTLE PLASTIC CUPS FILLING UP THE GARBAGE, AND IN OUR CASE TWO MACHINES IN THE DUMP. COME ON PEOPLE LETS HAVE SOME CONSCIOUS COMSUMERISM AND SLOW DOWN. What ever happened to putting the coffee in a paper filter and pouring hot water over it and letting the fragrance wrap around you. If you are that busy and needy for coffee instantly maybe you should be looking at the job ads or self help books and not over priced hunks of wasteful plastic for greedy americans
kitchen & housewares||2.0||I researched a lot before buying this slow cooker. I have a Nesco roaster that I love and use often. I needed a large slow cooker. I started researching. Started out with the all clad but everyone said it got really hot. I wanted a good one. The Cuisinart had good ratings elsewhere and I thought well even it cooks faster that is fine. I will just watch it until I get used to it and go from there. Every dish I have watched..they all cooked in LESS than half the allotted time. Today I made a crock pot mac and cheese casserole and it burned within ONE HOUR. Way too hot. I called Cuisinart several times and they said I may have a defective unit. Well I doubt it. I just think it runs hot. I really was dismayed because I love the size and the design of this cooker. Really was not up to par with Cuisinart products that I know and love. Let me also say that I am a good cook. I feel that I know my way around any appliance. I was not happy that I was not going to be able to leave this cooker all day but I was ok to give it a try. It is not at all what I expected. I read the other reviews here and wish I would have taken heed of them. I had read good reviews elsewhere and saw two articles in magazines on this cooker being the best. If you are going to spend 100 bucks on a slow cooker, stop, get one of the higher end rival ones with a timer and then get a nesco roaster. You can cook anything all summer without heating up your kitchen.

This rice cooker is absolutely the best. It has replaced the broken one hands down. The rice is perfect every time whether you make 2 servings or serve a crowd, it keeps it warm without ruining it and it is so easy to clean and store.  I would recommend this one to anyone that really likes rice and prepares it often.

Standard mixer, can't do anything too drastic with it, but I noticed the last time I took the beaters out of the dishwasher they had rusted.  These are not stainless beaters and they will rust.  I'm in the market for a new mixer

kitchen & housewares||4.0||As a long time critic of kitchen tools and ALL Miracle Whip applicators, I was skeptical when I was presented with this device. It uses the same "scraper/spatula" design that has been prevalent in the United States since the release of the Tupperware model R. At first glance I was not impressed with this tool. It was nothing flashy, although I must admit the red color was quite innovative. But, the real test would have to come when I put it into service. She wasn't as stiff as some of the hard plastic models I have tested, but not as floppy as most silicone models I have labored through. I would have to say it was a happy medium. So I dug right in and began making some fried wonton stuffed with Miracle Whip, and I must say this spatula sparkled. Pounds of Miracle Whip got stuffed into this little Asian number, and the spatula never failed. I knock off one point for the simple fact, that they don't offer a Miracle Whip branded version of this spatula. Now that would be really nice. Also, not quite strong enough to be used a tactical weapon, but quite suitable as a disciplinary tool

kitchen & housewares||1.0||I just received this knife yesterday & am sending it back for a refund.  Upon first use, the forked metal tip broke off when I was chopping tomatoes for a salad.  It took me a few moments to notice the lost tip (as it had ended up in the salad I was preparing.)  Could have been very dangerous to swallow a sharp metal tip!  The knife itself is flimsy, can't imagine that it could cut a bagel very well

kitchen & housewares||5.0||This is a wonderful appliance and at what a savings!  Mine arrived promptly and in "shipped from the manufacturer" condition.  This is such an improvement over my old waffle maker (no matter how much I greased it the waffles always stuck).The first time I tried it was on my new son-in-law and I was eager to make a good impression.  A red light indicates the appliance is on and a green light tells you when it's ready to cook.  My first waffle came out beautifully and you-know-who ate it with great satisfaction and requested another.  Then I screwed up.  You see, if you don't follow directions and forget to rotate the waffle maker your waffle splits in half and can't be put back together again!  Third time I did it right.Waffle grids slide out easily for cleaning in the dishwasher.  Outside of stainless steel appliance my be cleaned with soap and water or glass cleaner if you prefer.  Handle folds down and therefore the appliance stores easily.I was too busy to follow the gram instructions in the recipe booklet accompanying the waffle maker and too busy to beat egg whites separately.  So I used my tried and true pancake recipe which turned out great.  In the future I'll be more creative!Highly recommended for waffle lovers

kitchen & housewares||1.0||The soap shoots straight out of the pump and can go about three feet.  (Children would love this feature.)  You have to hold your hand awkwardly in front of the spout to keep the soap in your hand or pick up the pump and pump it directly into your palm.  Also the pump sticks and has to be pulled up manually.  You cannot use this pump with one hand - not good for kitchen use
kitchen & housewares||5.0||First thing we cooked in this pan were burgers, and we could not believe the difference in taste compared to pan fried.  The raised ridges really carmelize the meat, and even when cooked well done the burgers are juicy.  We have prepared chicken, pork chops and fish, and they are all at least as good as charcoal grilled.  I would give this pan 10 stars if I could
kitchen & housewares||5.0||Farberware 18/10 stainless steel cookware is a good line. I had this cookware at one time, and I can recommend it, especially for use on gas burners. Unlike Calphalon cookware, it can go in the dishwasher. However, to keep the finish gleaming, you might need to scrub the pots and pans frequently with cleanser and scouring pads. The 8-Quart Stockpot with Lid is a kitchen essential
kitchen & housewares||2.0||Looks great in my kitchen but I, too, only use it for shakes & smoothies.  It DOES smell like burning rubber nearly every time.  I used to think something was wrong with it and now I just disregard it.  And after less than two years or making smoothies, I'm replacing the blade & gasket assembly. 
kitchen & housewares||1.0||I ordered this cake plate and dome for my mother, shortly before Thanksgiving of 2002. The first time it arrived, after 3 weeks, it was in about 1,000 pieces. The UPS driver realized that upon delivery and returned the item. When it was sent the second time, which wasn't until around Christmas, it arrived with the handle to the dome broken off. So, long story short, no cake plate for Mom! Amazon.com should really examine how they pack items like this
kitchen & housewares||2.0||What I most like about this product is the crumb catcher feature.  Unfortunately, I have a problem with the acrylic piece at the end of the cutting board popping out when I am using it.  I would also recommend that the wood used be a harder wood such as is used normally with cutting boards as when I slice it leaves grooves in the wood
kitchen & housewares||1.0||I purchased this as a Christmas gift in early December. It didn't ship until February, which was okay. By then I liked the way it looked so much, I bought one for myself. They both arrived within a week of one another. Both boards were treated with heated food grade oil and allowed to sit and soak it in. After wiping off the oil, my board had surface cracks, where the oil had pulled some of the glue out from between the bamboo pieces. Within the first month of use, both boards developed cracks all the way through them. Both boards were never soaked in water, but just wiped with a damp cloth.This board may be beautiful, but it quickly became unusable and a waste of money. Now I'm looking for a good hardwood cutting board. (I've already replaced the gift board with another.) All in all, this fiasco of a cutting board has cost me around $150...and I have yet to replace my board

kitchen & housewares||1.0||I saw many good reviews for this toaster and a few bad ones too. I took my chances and ordered one anyway.Cuisinart is not testing these toasters. It took 10 seconds for me to see that the inner elements are not heating up. They are cleaning them, possibly changing the elements, and shipping them.  My guess is that it is just cheaper not to test them. Big mistake. It's harder to win back customers than to keep them.

kitchen & housewares||1.0||I recently ordered a Pedrini Black & Satin Stainless steel Tomato Slicer through Amazon.com. The delivery was very prompt.  The slicer came with a clear plastic cover for the blades.  But the problem is that the tomato slicer is very dull.  The tomatoes are literally torn up by the time they are completely sliced.  I would not order another one by Pedrini.  I am not pleased at all with my purchase
kitchen & housewares||1.0||Received this toaster as a Christmas present in 2004.  From day one I was not very happy with it.  The knobs and temperature control are difficult to use - sometimes it would bake good, other times it would not.  About 6 months ago I noticed the numbers were rubbed off of the timer dial.  About 3 months ago the timer dial became loose and it was difficult to set the time.  Today the timer dial broke off completely.  So I got about a year and a half of poor use out of it.  So, don't purchase this product, it is not worth it.

Except that when I used it as part of my Halloween party costume along with a doctor's lab coat and stethoscope, all the women blushed and left the room. Oh well, maybe next time I'll come as a proctologist
kitchen & housewares||5.0||Tired of those metal cocktail shakers where the top refuses to open when you go to clean it?  The vacuum that occurs with the metal variety has happened to us on every model we've tried.  The Boston Cocktail Shaker does not have this problem.  We had no difficulty whatsoever with a tight seal on the first try and have had no leakage problems.  The only drawback (very minor) is that the measurement lines do not go all the way to the bottom of the glass.  So if you're measuring out small quantities of liquor, you still need to use a jigger.  Other than that, it is very easy to use and clean.  Top rating for this bar helper
